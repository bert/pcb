title: WARNING: DRC doesn't catch everything
explanation: Detection of outright shorts, missing connections, etc.
is handled via rat's nest addition.  To catch these problems,
display the message log using Window->Message Log, then use
Connects->Optimize rats nest (O hotkey) and watch for messages.
