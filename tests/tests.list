# This code was derived from code written by Dan McMahill as part of the
# latex-mk testsuite.  The original code was covered by a BSD license
# but the copyright holder is releasing the version for pcb under the GPL.
#
#
# Format:
#
# test_name | layout file(s) | [export hid name] | [optional arguments to pcb] |  [mismatch]
# | output file(s)
#
# test_name - a single string with no spaces, tabs, *, +, ? (i.e. any "special"
# characters) that identifies the test.
#
# layout file(s) - a list of layout files.  Files listed are relative to
# the $(top_srcdir)/tests/inputs directory.
#
# [export hid name] - the name of the export HID to use.  This is used both for
# running pcb as well as determining how we process the output
#
# [optional arguments to pcb] - a list of additional arguments to be passed to pcb.
# This is where one would specify additional options which are specific to a particular
# export HID.
#
# [mismatch] If specified as "mismatch" (no quotes), then the result 
# should *not* match the reference.  This can be thought of as a test
# on the testsuite to make sure we can properly detect when a change has
# occurred.
#
# output file(s) - a list of output files and their associated types.  For
# example:
#  bom:bom_general.bom xy:test.txt
# specifies that "bom_general.bom" is created and it is a bill of materials file
# and that "test.txt" is created and it is a centroid (X-Y) file.
#
# File types grouped by which HID produces them are:
#
# BOM
#
#    bom -- PCB bill of materials file
#    xy  -- PCB centroid file
#
# GERBER
#
#    cnc -- Excellon drill file
#    gbx -- RS274-X (Gerber) file
#
# PNG
#
#    gif -- GIF file
#    jpg -- JPEG file
#    png -- Portable network graphics (PNG) file
#
