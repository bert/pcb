<p>These are instructions on building a Windows installer under
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> but with a
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> toolchain and libraries.<br>
The result is an installer which does not depend on Cygwin.<br>
If you are looking for instructions on cross-compiling from linux
or other systems, then refer to section above.</p>

<p>These instructions were written based on cygwin64.<br>
When you install cygwin64 on your system, you will need to ensure that
you have installed:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>autoconf</li>
    <li>automake</li>
    <li>bash</li>
    <li>bison</li>
    <li>flex</li>
    <li>gawk</li>
    <li>intltool</li>
    <li>make</li>
    <li>m4</li>
    <li>sed</li>
  </ul>
In addition, you will need the MinGW cross compilation packages.<br>
At the time of writing this, the the list of packages installed which
have been shown to work is contained in:<br>
<pre>
    win32/mingw_required_pkgs
</pre>
That list was obtained via:<br>
<pre>
    cygcheck -c | grep mingw
</pre>
In addition I have:<br>
<pre>
w32api-headers                        4.0.4-1                      OK
w32api-runtime                        4.0.4-1                      OK
</pre>
<br>
Once these have all been installed then when building from a tarball,
extract, cd win32 and run;<br>
<pre>
    ./build_pcb
</pre>
This will create a windows installer.<br>
<br>
If you are building from git you will need additional tools to build
the documentation which can be skipped using:<br>
<pre>
    ./build_pcb --disable-doc
</pre>
