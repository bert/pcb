User experience improvements
----------------------------
- reorchestrated the closing of the command window to not crash.
- only invalidate the screen after changes to the crosshair or mark are
  complete.


Plugins
-------
- none


Exporters
---------
- fix for gcode dimensions.
- added a regression test for the IPC-D-356 exporter.
- added more documentation for the IPC-D-356 netlist exporter.


Footprints library
------------------
- add macro with more programmability for 2 pin axial components. Use
  this to add a few IPC-7251 compliant footprints for axial inductors,
  horizontally mounted.  Use this in turn for the TDK B82145A RF chokes
  family.
- add toko category and the 7P variable inductors.
- gen_geda_*.awk were nearly identical to gen_*.awk so add 2 lines to
  geda.inc so we can use the same script for everything.  Verified that
  pcblib-newlib builds with identical results before/after.
- for the horizontally mounted axial macro add the missing bits for
  marking polarity on parts like diodes.
- add PKG_RADIAL_MM100 macro for doing more general metric 2 pin radial
  packages.
- add some IPC radial capacitor footprints and use those to create some
  united chemicon footprints.
- add DO-41 diode package, horizontally mounted.
- add PKG_MTHOLE_GENERIC macro for fairly generic mounting holes.  Use
  this to define IPC mounting holes for #4 and #6 machine screws with
  pan heads or flat washers for both "tight" (board < 4") and "loose"
  (board > 4") fits.
- add TO-263 footprint.
- add some notes about m4 library development.
- fix problem in some possible invocations of the generic mounting hole
  macro.  All footprints pass syntax checks again.
- remove an extra empty attribute which is not needed and causes
  warnings in the mounting hole macro.
- fix clearance on the Toko 7P footprint.
- in the mounting hole macro, change the calculation of the pad size for
  the support vias to make them as large as possible without actually
  changing the copper (the support vias are covered by the main pad).
  This does not affect the fabricated board but it does remove some
  false positive DRC complaints.


Developer experience improvements
---------------------------------
- allow translators to change number of tabs in message.
- In the test suite, check for a working X display using xhost before
  running action script tests
- match() with 3 arguments is a gawk extension. Rework the code to avoid
  using a 3 argument call to match() in one spot.  Lets the script run
  with gawk or NetBSD's awk (20121220).  Verified that the generated
  result is identical to the previous gawk result using both gawk and
  NetBSDs awk.
- change from AC_FD_CC to AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD
- removed the antifork abomination.
- disabled one of the checks used to deal with older gdlib installs on
  some linux systems when building under cygwin as the test has
  problems.  Repairs building for mingw under cygwin.
- when building under cygwin, create a pcbtest.bat batch file that
  allows testing the compiled pcb without installing.  This is somewhat
  analogous to the pcbtest.sh script generated on linux and other
  unix-like systems.
- cleanup the win32 build script a good bit.  An important change is
  that instead of blindly installing all of the mingw cross system root
  files, only install a set of listed ones.  This not only reduces the
  size of the windows installer but makes sure we have a more repeatable
  build and know what we are actually bundling into the installer.
- fixed the Attribute deletion code.

Release notes for pcb-4.0.0
========================================================================

Dear Users,

It has been quite some time since the last snapshot of pcb was released
in March 2014.

Since then quite a lot of bugs were fixed and new features added, below
this introduction a summary is given of the improvements and additions
since the latest snapshot "pcb-20140316".

This release represents over 480 commits (mostly bugfixes and code
refactoring) and as such this summary clearly is not complete.

This pcb release 4.0.0 has a significant change in the major version
number.

This is done to make a fresh start and to get away from the 1.99z
version with YYYYMMDD snapshots.

Kind regards,

The pcb development team


User experience improvements
----------------------------
- added the command-line option --save-metric-only.
- added escaping of Attribute values.
- added a translation of the Getting Started with PCB for pt_BR.
- added translatable tooltips for toolbar buttons.
- added "Report net length" to Menu -> Info in Gtk.
- added a script for generating a key binding list.
- added tooltips in the GTK HID UI.
- the puller no longer crosses unplated holes.
- solder/component outer layer names changed to top/bottom.
- pcb now uses a tilde instead of a dash for backup filenames.
- corrections in the user documentation.
- the position "delta" display no longer forces the GTK HID window to
  grow.
- write time in ASCII locale into exported files.
- allow for up to 10000 dpi on png exporter output.


Plugins
-------
- added smartdisperse for dispersing elements better, contributed by
  Ben Jackson.
- added relocate for relocating elements, contributed by Jean Richard.
- added RenumberBlock() and RenumberBuffer(), contributed by DJ Delorie.
- added teardrops(), contributed by DJ Delorie.


Exporters
---------
- added a netlister conforming to the IPC-D-356 standard, contributed by
  Jerome Marchand.
- changed "as-shown" to "screen-layer-order" in the png and eps hids.


Footprints library
------------------
- added a SC88A footprint.
- added a LQFP80-10 footprint.
- added QFN24_5 and TQFN24_5 footprints.
- added a SOD523 footprint.
- the SOT325 package had a wrong numbering.
- renamed the SOT325 footprint to SOT353.
- in the ALF footprint the drill holes were too tight.
- an infinite loop in the SIL m4 macro was fixed.


Developer experience improvements
---------------------------------
- made a start with adding Doxygen developer documentation tags in the
  source files.
  A pcb.dox configuration file is available in the "doc/doxygen"
  directory so developers can build the documentation there by invoking
  "doxygen pcb.dox" from the CLI.
  This is not done by configuring with --enable-docs, which is solely
  reserved for the generation of User documentation.
- added numerous fixes in the win32 target.


Notes for early adapters
------------------------
In the git repository two tags have been added to allow for checking
out of pcb-4.0.0 at the branch point (git checkout pcb-4.0.0-base) or at
the release point (git checkout pcb-4.0.0-RELEASE).
This is in line with tagging done in former snapshots.


Changed dependencies
--------------------
- autoconf 2.60 --> 2.69.
- gettext 0.14 --> 0.19.3.

Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20140316
========================================================================
This release represents over 421 commits (mostly bugfixes and code
refactoring) and as such this summary clearly is not complete.  See
the ChangeLog file for the complete list of changes.

Features
--------

- GTK gui uses GL now, including a pseudo-3D mode.

========================================================================
Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20110918
========================================================================
This release represents over 797 commits and as such this summary 
clearly is not complete.  See the ChangeLog file for the complete list
of changes.

Features
--------

- Internal coordinate space is now metric.  This should fix the "trace
  nubs on metric grids" issue.  Also, units are allowed on pretty much
  every "coordinate" that PCB accepts.  Example: 5.4in, 10cm, 0.55mm.
  New configure option --enable-coord64 to force (slower?) 64-bit type
  for coordinates on 32-bit systems (if you need a board bigger than 1
  meter across).  The internal precision is 1 nanometer, the internal
  type is "Coord".
- MinGW support.
- New GL mode for the gtk hid with translucent traces.

- New GTK layer view/choose widget and other GUI enhancements.
- GTK HID warns if the *.pcb file has changed on disk.
- Enhanced grid snapping logic.
- Select/report nets by name.
- Auto-pan has been removed.
- Zoom can zoom out beyond the edge of the board's workspace.
- GTK: title string matches GNOME conventions.
- Personally identifiable information is no longer stored in the PCB.
- Toggling vias from hole to plated is reversible.
- Gerber exporter has options for including outlines on other layers.
- Edited footprint files are saved as footprints, not pcbs.
- Improved gtk library search/filter.
- Default layer stack is now a six-layer template with outline.
- If the board has an outline layer, an outline will be shown if no
  other outline is specified.
- Group[] string allows t/b synonyms for c/s.  "top" and "bottom" are
  the standard names now.
- PCB will save files with an older version tag if newer features aren't needed.
- Autorouter has a progress dialog.
- PCB will no longer let you delete the last top/bottom layer.
- Refcard has been updated.
- Documentation updates.
- Layes with the PCB::skip-drc attribute set are ignored during DRC.
- Allow numeric keys to also choose the silk layer.
- Minor readability tweaks to the default font.
- Via copper may overlap.
- User is notified if an Import() cannot find all the footprints.

========================================================================
Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20060414
========================================================================
- This is the first snapshot of the new HID version of PCB.  HID, which
  stands for Human Interface Device is the abstraction created by
  DJ Delorie which seperates the core PCB code from the graphical user
  interface.  In this release, two GUI HID's are supported, gtk and lesstif.
  In addition, there are HID exporters for postscript and encapsulated
  postscript, RS-274-X (gerber), bill of materials, centroid file, and
  png/gif/jpeg.  This represents a major restructuring of the code and
  many months of work.

- PCB's actions (the commands which drive the core of the program and
  may be directly accessed by the user) now have the documentation in-line
  in the code and the actions reference section of the manual is 
  extracted from the in-line documentation.  The goal it to provide more
  complete and accurate documentation.  As always the manual is still
  a work in progress but it is getting more complete and up to date.

- Fixed a long standing segfault when saving connection data

- Fixed a DRC bug

- Fix some rounding issues when setting sizes.  Hopefully this will address
  the issue with 23.99 mil drills and related problems.

- The html manual is now in one file instead of many files

- The lesstif HID now supports loading of background images to help
  recover a layout which may exist in hardcopy form only.

========================================================================
Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20060321
========================================================================
- Add internal support for more than 8 layers.  By default PCB is still
  compiled for 8 copper layers.
- Fixed several minor bugs in the GTK user interface including fixing
  scrolling of the log window, fixed up some of the DRC reporting
  and mm/mil units.
- Fixed several key bindings.
- Updated refcard.tex to reflect the current set of key bindings.
- Fixed some minor bugs which caused compilation problems on some
  systems.
- Converted the QFN footprints to hi-res.
- Added documentation to the manual for the centroid file format and
  the algorithm used for finding the centroid and rotation.
- Fixed a bug so that the initial layer named 'component' is actually
  on the component side of the board and 'solder' is actually on the
  solder side of the board.
- Fixed the pin order in the bourns trim pots (~bourns library)
- Added actions and a script to allow command line printing.
- Added IPC-7351 recommended footprints for 0201, 0402, etc passives.
- Fixed SME5 package.
- Fixed a bug which prevented disabling nets from the ratsnest
- Fixed a bug where clearances could be set 1 below the spacing

- Fixed a bug in computation of the closest polygon point.
- Use rtrees for polygon handling for speed improvements.
- Add a ChangePinName() action.
- Fix a bug which caused duplicate rats names when manually adding
  rats lines.
- Added DRC checks for minimum drill diameter and minimum annular ring.
- Add a minimal glossary to the manual
- Fix the author name in the fab drawing
- Cause the crosshair to snap to pad ends instead of center for rat
  drawing.
- Add "join" to SetFlag, ClrFlag and ChangeFlag.
- Added inline documentation for the pcb file syntax.  The manual now
  is up to date and correctly documents the file format.  In addition
  the inline documentation will make it much easier to maintain the
  documentation.
- Remove some broken m4lib footprints
- Put the correct setting for the gschem footprint= attribute in []
  in the library window for the m4 libraries.

========================================================================
Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20050609
========================================================================

- **** The GUI is now based on gtk2 instead of Xaw ****  This represents
  a fairly major change.  You will now need gtk-2.4 or higher installed
  along with any of its dependencies to build pcb.  On linux
  distributions, it is probably the case that you already have this,
  but see the README-GTK_PORT file for a note on gtk versions.
  For *BSD, Solaris, and others, you may want to use NetBSD's pkgsrc
  to help install gtk2 and its dependencies.

- Flags are stored symbolically in the .pcb file.  This is the start
  of moving to support >8 layers.  Please note that >8 layer support
  is not yet available in this snapshot.

- Fixes for gcc-4

- As part of the switch to gtk2, the user customizable menu feature has
  been temporarily broken.  Hopefully this will be fixed by the next
  snapshot.  In addition, the loading of background images has also been
  temporarily broken.

========================================================================
Release Notes for PCB snapshot 20050315

- Fix a name_tree corruption bug when changing an element name.

- Don't remove the formatted manual with a 'make clean' since they are
  part of the distfile.

  - Correct pin count on HEADER60_2 (60 not 50) (~geda library)

========================================================================

New Features for 2.0

(1) New library system. A directory tree is parsed and added to the library 
selector window. This directory is specified in the config.h file as 
PCBTREEDIR and should point to a directory where any pcb user that needs to 
create library elements has write privileges. The "-libtree X" switch will 
cause pcb to use directory X instead of the installed default for the new 
library directory. You should continue to be wary of the old library 
elements, many of them are not quite right. (Just check them carefully before 
fabing to be sure there are no surprises). My intent is to create a 
repository for new elements THAT PEOPLE HAVE FABRICATED SUCCESSFULLY in order 
to grow a reliable library.

(2) Element files can now contain layers (line, arcs, polygons), vias and 
elements. The new library system reads from element files (no need to learn 
M4). The expanded capability of element files allows you to put useful 
sub-circuits into the library. For example, a QFP package with a break-out 
via pattern can be stored as a library element. Be careful with this as the 
layers are saved simply by their layer number and lose any association with a 
group (e.g. whether it is the component, or solder-side layer).

(3) Improved fascilities for creating elements from drawn objects. Now you 
can put an element in the buffer, and break it into it's consitutent parts. 
Paste this to the layout, make changes, then put it back in the buffer to 
convert to an element. You can also save a buffer's contents to an element 
file (i.e. add it to the library). Of course element files are still just 
text files so you can edit them at will. Draw the element outline on the silk 
layer (lines and arcs, no polygons), use Vias to make pins or holes, and lines 
on the component and/or solder layers for SMD pads. Number the pins and pads 
with the name ("n" key) entry, then cut it all to the buffer and select 
"convert buffer to element". Saved elements always appear in the file in a 
component-side orientation (even if you save while viewing the solder side).

(4) Support for elements with surface-mount pads on both sides of the board. 
e.g. edge connectors. This also allows creation of elements with multiple
pins/pads having the same "number" string. This can be used, for example,
to create a DIP footprint that has a pad on top and bottom coincident
with each pin. This effectively makes the pins have elongated copper pads
on the top and bottom - something several home-made board makers have
requested.  If you do create an element with multiple pins having the
same number, and that number appears in the netlist, they MUST be connected
before the board is considered routed. See the "14DIP_oval_pad" example
in the "test" section of the library for an example.

(5) Support for the strokes library. Compiling with strokes enabled (see 
config.h) binds the middle button to recognize strokes for the user 
interface. Zoom in, Zoom out, choose the line, arrow, or via tools, rotate an 
object, etc. can be done with simple strokes. Check the source code 
(FinishStroke() in action.c) to see what the strokes are.

(6) Better fascilites for panning at high zoom: Shift-button3 down shows the 
whole layout - move the crosshair to where you want the display centered, 
then release the mouse button - the previous zoom level is restored, centered 
at the new location. You can do this while in the middle of drawing, moving, 
etc. You can also place the cursor in the panner area, and use the arrow keys 
on the keyboard to scroll half a window view per keypress. Of course you can 
still drag the screen with button1 with the panner tool (previously known
as no tool).
Auto-scrolling is also improved. If you want to use menus, buttons,
the panner, placing the pointer over them stops auto-scroll. If you
want to go to another window and not auto-scroll, pass the pointer
over one of those things before heading to the other window.

(7) Auto-router. The auto-router routes with the active line size, via size, 
and keep-away. It is a grid-less router, and will automatically avoid any 
existing traces, etc. that you've placed on the board. It uses all layers 
that are visible when invoked, so turn off any layers you don't want it to 
use. You can auto-route all rat lines, or selected rat lines. This was
written by C. Scott Ananian

(8) Fascilities to rip-up tracks and vias that were placed by the 
auto-router. You can rip-up all auto-routed tracks, or just those that are 
selected (and were auto-routed).

(9) Auto-placement code. It's broken. Don't use it.

(10) Many functions added to the menus that were previously accessible only 
through keys or typed commands. e.g. SetValue(Grid,1), DRC().

(11) You can turn on/off the requirement for unique element names. When 
unique names are required, they may be automatically generated when pasting. 
Turn on uniqueness for a single layout, turn off if placing several boards in 
a panel (or if you just want duplicate names). It's in the settings menu.

(12) Support for metric grids. Coordinates are still always integer mils,
but you can have the grid fall on a regular metric spacing to within
+/- 1 mil. Selectable in the "Screen" menu and also with the "SetValue(Grid, x)"
command; the value x is still in mils, but it's floating point now. Also
the concept of "absolute" grid has been eliminated - just align it where
you want.

(13) Support for viewing the soldermask. The Screen menu has a selection for
turning on/off the display of the solder mask. You can also change the
size of mask holes when the mask is displayed by using the
"ChangeClearSize(what, change)" function (k key). If the mask is not
displayed, this function changes polygon clearances as before. For example
you could elliminate all via soldermask holes by selecting everything
(make sure vias are turned on), then typing the command:
":ChangeClearSize(SelectedVias, 0)" There is a special case for
vias to change the mask diameter equal to the via diameter, by using
+0 as the size change.
 
(14) Support for creation/addition of netlist by drawing rat lines.
Select "netlist" from the drawing layer, and use the line tool to
add nets. Undo removes the rat, but not the created net. To delete
a netlist entry, select the connection in the netlist window and
hit the backspace key. The "netlist" layer must be the active layer
to delete connections like this. This is NOT the recommended way
to create a netlist, but a lot of people asked for it.

(15) Support for snapping the crosshair to pins/pads even when they're not on
grid. Selectable in the "Settings" menu. Thanks to Borges for this
great idea.

(16) Doesn't draw negative lines and arcs in print output unless
necessary. It still does this for all pads though. Doesn't technically
matter, but there are a lot of bogus gerber viewers out there and
people that are easily confused by gerber files that completely meet
the specification.

(17) Added a "Lock" feature that lets you lock an object so it
can't be selected, moved, or modified. Very handy for making a
board-outline element (e.g. pc104 card) invisible to the Arrow
tool.

(18) lots of bug fixes (plus, no doubt, lots of newly introduced ones).

(19) a tool (in the tools folder) for converting to/from ncap files
for auto-routing with MUCS-PCB. I have not tried this myself. Written
By Luis Claudio G. Lopes

(20) a new build system based on the GNU automake and autoconf tools.
This should make compiling on different systems easier than with the
old imake based build system.
 
(21) A program for quickly generating QFP elements. Its invoked
from the old library (~generic/qfp menu, generic)

(22) Increased resolution.  The internal unit is now 0.01 mil
as opposed to 1.0 mil which was the previous unit.

Quick and dirty explanation of some as-yet undocumented features:

Netlist window: double-click on a net-name to enable/disable it. A "*" 
appears next to the name when it is disabled. Disabled means rats nests will 
ignore the net. Click on a connection to select it (and center it) in the 
layout window. "Finding" a connection starting from a pin or pad will
select it in the netlist window.

The "j" key controls whether a line (arc) clears (plow through) polygons or 
touches them. Newly created lines and arcs follow the setting in the 
"settings" menu. Put the cursor over the line or arc you want to change, then 
hit the "j" (j for join) key.

The "k" key controls the width of clearance around a line (arc) when it 
plows. "k" key increases clearance by 2, Shift-K decreases it by 2, also 
works for pins and vias piercing polygons. The initial value for new objects 
(but not element pins/pads which is in the element definition)
is controlled by the "keepaway" setting, changeable in the "sizes" menu.

When drawing lines, you can start a new anchor point without drawing from 
the previous point by either clicking button3, or Ctrl-button1. DON'T
USE BUTTON2 - that would be wrong, even if it sort of works.

The Arrow tool is for selecting/deselecting objects, and moving them. 
Shift-click to add to the existing selection. You can click-drag to draw 
boxes for box selection. If you click-drag on an already selected item, you 
will move the selection. If you click-drag on an un-selected item, you will 
move that item without selecting it. This last technique is the only way to 
move a point (e.g. end point of a line), and is also the only way to perform 
moves with rubber-banding (i.e. rubber-banding doesn't work with selections). 
Moving a selection actually cuts it to a special paste buffer, then pastes it 
at the new location. Always start a box selection by clicking in an empty 
region of the board. It may be desireable to turn off some visibility in 
order to simplify the box selection operation.  You can also lock
an object to make it invisible to the Arrow tool (so box selections can
begin over the object). If you don't configure for
strokes, the middle button is bound to the arrow tool.

To move an element or silk text to the opposite side of the board, use the 
"b" key (b for backside) to send it to the opposite side. You can also cut an 
object to a buffer, switch viewing sides (tab), then paste it. The buffer can 
be used this way to flip layout traces to the other side too, although if 
layer groups are used, the precise layer they appear on may not have the 
color you want, but the connectivity should not change.


Installation tip: BE SURE TO INSTALL THE NEW X11 RESOURCE FILE - run
make install to do this. If you just want to test without installing,
run the pcbtest.sh script in the src directory.
