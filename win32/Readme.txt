This is the windows port of the pcb printed circuit board
layout editor.

Please visit http://pcb.geda-project.org for more information about PCB.

The windows port makes use of GTK+ for windows.   Please visit
http://www.gtk.org for more information about GTK.  Without all the hard
work of the GTK+ authors, PCB would not exist in its current form.

The windows installer was created with NSIS.  Please visit
http://nsis.sourceforge.net for more information about NSIS.
