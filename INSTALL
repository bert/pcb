PCB uses a standard GNU autoconf/automake based build
system which should make compilation go smoothly on most unix-like
systems.  Please do read this first section however.

If there is no "configure" script, e.g. because you pulled sources
from the Git repository, make sure you have autopoint and autoconf
installed, then run:

  ./autogen.sh

This will set up and run autoconf to create configure.

PCB is organized into a core program that deals with all of the
internal database procedures and a collection of Human Interface
Devices (HID's).  The HID's provide exporting/printing capability
as well as a graphical user interface.  At the time of writing
this document PCB includes the following HIDs:

GUI HID's:
     gtk      -- GTK based GUI.  This is the default GUI.  You will
		 need gtk-2.4 or newer installed (both the runtime
		 files as well as the developer headers).  You only
		 need gtk if you want the gtk HID.

     lesstif  -- motif/lesstif based GUI.  To use the lesstif HID
		 you will need Motif, OpenMotif, or Lesstif installed.
		 Again you need both libraries and headers.

     The choice of which gui to use (if you want something other than 
     the default of GTK) is indicated with the --with-gui configure
     option.  Examples are:
       --with-gui=lesstif  = picks the lesstif HID
       --with-gui=gtk      = picks the GTK HID
       --without-gui       = specifies that no GUI will be built.  This
			     option is primarily intended for use in a
			     web server environment where you may wish
			     to export .pcb files to graphical files on
			     the fly but you do not want to install
			     X11 or any GUI tooliks on the server.

Export HID's:
     ps       -- Postscript and Encapsulated Postscript output.  No
		 additional libraries are needed for this.

     gcode    -- CNC G-CODE output (experimental).  The gdlib library
                 is used by this HID.  gdlib may be found at
                 http://www.libgd.org

     gerber   -- RS-274-X (Gerber) and Excellon drill output.  No
		 additional libraries are needed for this.

     bom      -- Bill of materials (BOM) and Centroid (X-Y) output.
		 No additional libraries are needed for this.

     png      -- png/gif/jpeg output.  This HID uses gdlib to do
		 the majority of the work.  gdlib may be obtained
		 from http://www.libgd.org.  At the time of
		 writing this document, I have tested with 
		 gd-2.0.23 and gd-2.0.33.  Other versions may
		 work as well.

		 Since some installations of gdlib may not support
		 all three of the formats mentioned here (png, gif,
		 and jpeg), PCB provides configure options to individually
		 turn off each of these output formats.  These options
		 are:
		   --disable-gif, --disable-jpeg, and --disable-png
		 By having you, the user, explicitly turn off the different
		 formats hopefully it will avoid suprises when the
		 disabled formats are not available at runtime.

    The choice of which export HID's to compile is indicated with:

      --with-exporters="ps gerber bom png"

    By default all available exporters will be configured in if --with-exporters
    is not given.  

Printer HID's:
     lpr     -- Unix line printer support.  No additional libraries are
		needed for this.

     The choice of which printer HID's to compile is indicated with:

       --with-printers="lpr"

     By default all available printers will be configured in if --with-printers
     is not given.

In addition to the libraries listed above, there is a graphical QFP footprint
creator which uses TCL/TK.  If you do not wish to use this feature, and you
do not have TCL/TK installed on your system, you may simply set WISH to
/usr/bin/true in your configure environment.  For example:

  env WISH=/usr/bin/true ./configure


Please refer to the output of

  ./configure --help

for the most up to date details on the options.

After running ./configure with your selected options, run

  make

to build PCB.  You can try out the program by running

  cd src
  ./pcbtest.sh

prior to installation.

To install PCB after it has been built run:

  make install

from the top level directory.

-------- Summary of dependencies --------------------

- GNU m4.  In particular your m4 must support -F for frozen files.

- wish (part of tcl/tk).  If not installed, set WISH=/bin/false in
  your configure environment and you just won't get the graphical
  QFP footprint builder

- gtk if you are using the gtk frontend

- motif or lesstif if you are using the lesstif frontend

- gdlib if you are using the png HID

- GNU make for building

- flex

- bison

-------- Standard GNU INSTALL Instructions Follow --------------------

This is a generic INSTALL file for utilities distributions.
If this package does not come with, e.g., installable documentation or
data files, please ignore the references to them below.

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.  In the directory that this
file is in, type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.

Running `configure' takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
see the messages, run `configure' with its standard output redirected
to `/dev/null'; for example, `./configure >/dev/null'.

To compile the package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the VPATH variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the directory
where you want the object files and executables to go and run
`configure'.  `configure' automatically checks for the source code in
the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  If for some reason
`configure' is not in the source code directory that you are
configuring, then it will report that it can't find the source code.
In that case, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR', where
DIR is the directory that contains the source code.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
/usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, /usr/local/man, etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than /usr/local by giving `configure' the option
`--prefix=PATH'.  Alternately, you can do so by consistently giving a value
for the `prefix' variable when you run `make', e.g.,
	make prefix=/usr/gnu
	make prefix=/usr/gnu install

You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If
you give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH' or set the
`make' variable `exec_prefix' to PATH, the package will use PATH as
the prefix for installing programs and libraries.  Data files and
documentation will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files
are installed using the regular prefix.

Another `configure' option is useful mainly in `Makefile' rules for
updating `config.status' and `Makefile'.  The `--no-create' option
figures out the configuration for your system and records it in
`config.status', without actually configuring the package (creating
`Makefile's and perhaps a configuration header file).  Later, you can
run `./config.status' to actually configure the package.  You can also
give `config.status' the `--recheck' option, which makes it re-run
`configure' with the same arguments you used before.  This option is
useful if you change `configure'.

Some packages pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options to `configure',
where PACKAGE is something like `gnu-libc' or `x' (for the X Window System).
The README should mention any --with- options that the package recognizes.

`configure' ignores any other arguments that you give it.

If your system requires unusual options for compilation or linking
that `configure' doesn't know about, you can give `configure' initial
values for some variables by setting them in the environment.  In
Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the command line like
this:
	CC='gcc -traditional' DEFS=-D_POSIX_SOURCE ./configure

The `make' variables that you might want to override with environment
variables when running `configure' are:

(For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:)
CC		C compiler program.
		Default is `cc', or `gcc' if `gcc' is in your PATH.
INSTALL		Program to use to install files.
		Default is `install' if you have it, `cp' otherwise.

(For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:)
DEFS		Configuration options, in the form `-Dfoo -Dbar ...'
		Do not use this variable in packages that create a
		configuration header file.
LIBS		Libraries to link with, in the form `-lfoo -lbar ...'

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we
can include them in the next release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.  If you want, you can override
the `make' variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS like this:

	make CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s

3.  If the package comes with self-tests and you want to run them,
type `make check'.  If you're not sure whether there are any, try it;
if `make' responds with something like
	make: *** No way to make target `check'.  Stop.
then the package does not come with self-tests.

4.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation.

5.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
Makefile(s), the header file containing system-dependent definitions
(if the package uses one), and `config.status' (all the files that
`configure' created), type `make distclean'.

The file `configure.in' is used as a template to create `configure' by
a program called `autoconf'.  You will only need it if you want to
regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
