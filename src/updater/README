This document is reflecting thoughts and ideas for the updater utility.

What is it?
-----------
This is an updater utility for pcb.

Why?
----
The User may want to be informed about the latest bleeding edge version
of pcb, and to be able to use a version with the latest features.

What does it do?
----------------
The basic idea is that this utility checks wether there is a newer version
available on either the official pcb git repository at gpleda.org, or if
there is a newer version of the tarball available at pcb.sourceforge.net
or Launchpad (in the near future ?).

Therefor the updater has to know which current (installed) version (either
tarball or git based) is run (installed) by the user, and the latest
version available pcb.sourceforge.net or Launchpad (in the near future ?).

How does it work?
-----------------
A possible solution for obtaining the latest version information is
doing a request with libsoup (yes, this is a new dependency).

The information of the current pcb version can be  derived from the
local pcb git repository with the command "git describe".
