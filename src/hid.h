/*

The way the HID layer works is that you instantiate a HID device
structure, and invoke functions through its members.  Code in the
common part of PCB may *not* rely on *anything* other than what's
defined in this file.  Code in the HID layers *may* rely on data and
functions in the common code (like, board size and such) but it's
considered bad form to do so when not needed.

Coordinates are ALWAYS in pcb's default resolution (1/100 mil at the
moment).  Positive X is right, positive Y is down.  Angles are
degrees, with 0 being right (positive X) and 90 being up (negative Y).
All zoom, scaling, panning, and conversions are hidden inside the HID
layers.

The main structure is at the end of this file.

Data structures passed to the HIDs will be copied if the HID needs to
save them.  Data structures retured from the HIDs must not be freed,
and may be changed by the HID in response to new information.
