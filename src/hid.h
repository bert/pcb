 * \brief Human Interface Device.
 *
 * \author This file, hid.h, was written and is
 * Copyright (c) 2006 DJ Delorie <dj@delorie.com>
 *
 * The way the HID layer works is that you instantiate a HID device
 * structure, and invoke functions through its members.
 *
 * Code in the common part of PCB may *not* rely on *anything* other
 * than what's defined in this file.
 *
 * Code in the HID layers *may* rely on data and functions in the common
 * code (like, board size and such) but it's considered bad form to do
 * so when not needed.
 *
 * Coordinates are ALWAYS in pcb's default resolution.
 *
 * Positive X is right, positive Y is down.
 *
 * Angles are degrees, with 0 being right (positive X) and 90 being up
 * (negative Y).
 *
 * All zoom, scaling, panning, and conversions are hidden inside the HID
 * layers.
 *
 * The main structure is at the end of this file.
 *
 * Data structures passed to the HIDs will be copied if the HID needs to
 * save them.
 *
 * Data structures retured from the HIDs must not be freed, and may be
 * changed by the HID in response to new information.
