PCB

pcb is a computer aided design (CAD) program for the physical
design of printed circuit boards (PCB).

For installing the release refer to the file 'INSTALL' in the toplevel
directory.

For additional information read the manual (doc/pcb.pdf) 

If you are updating you may wish to read the ChangeLog

There is also a bug tracking system available which can
be found from http://pcb.gpleda.org.  


OpenSCAD export HID

This is the directory where the OpenSCAD HID for pcb lives.

Please note that there are no OpenSCAD 3D models included in this
directory, nor in any other directory of pcb.

This because of the choice that "content" is a responsibility of
the users, and not a responsibility of the pcb developers.

However there are some OpenSCAD 3D models available at:

https://github.com/bert/openscad-models

In this git repository you will find some 3D models (*.scad files) of
frequently used electronics parts, just to get you started.

Feel free to use, copy, modify these 3D models to your needs, or share by
git clone and if you choose to, you can put your own 3D models on Github
for free (as in beer and free speech) too.

The OpenSCAD 3D models are invoked into a toplevel 3D model by means of
the content of the description field of elements available in the pcb
file.

In pcb jargon these are known as footprints (in *.fp files) or elements
(in the *.pcb file).

If the text in the description field contains a ".fp" suffix this will be
stripped and replaced with a ".scad" suffix in the toplevel 3D model.

Noticed that whitespace < > and tabs <TAB> are removed (stripped) as well.
