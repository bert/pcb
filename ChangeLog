	* src/hid/png/png.c: Fix bug tracker # 3064887 PNG exported all black in photo mode if the "outline" was exactly
	the board size, because the left/bottom edges were clipped leaving a
	big hole.  With this patch, we do two things: 1. Detect a non-trivial outline, and only do outline processing if
	found.  Thus, a rectangular outline exactly the size of the board is
	just ignored - no black border on the output image.  2. Any outline line that's drawn exactly on the bottom/right edge is
	brought in by half a pixel to ensure it's drawn in the resulting
	image.

	Split usage of "max_layer" into max_copper_layer and max_group  PCB has an equal number of layer groups as copper layers, so the
	"max_layer" #define'd variable has been used throught the codebase
	to delimit iteration over both layer groups, and layers.  This makes it hard for people reading the codebase to identify
	whether a given loop is over layers or layer groups (since the
	counter variable is often fairly terse or indescript). Confusingly,
	in some of the code, layer groups indexes are stored in a variable
	called "layer".  To aid understanding of the code, this commit removes the max_layer
	variable (#define'd to (PCB->Data->LayerN)), and replaces it with
	two similarly #define'd variables, "max_copper_layer" and
	"max_group".  This commit also introduces convenience macros:   #define solder_silk_layer (max_copper_layer + SOLDER_LAYER)   #define component_silk_layer (max_copper_layer + COMPONENT_LAYER) Which make the code intention much clearer for a common case of the
	old max_layer variable usage.

	in the layer group and use that.

	* src/find.c: Fix crash due to uninitalised variable in DRC check
	Bug #3033772 Andrew Armenia  noted that the second pointer returned from
	BuildObjectList(), "object_type_list" would be left uninitialised if
	the object type was not encountered. A subsequent call to free() in
	DRCFind() would then cause memory corruption.  The issue was originally reported by Ineiev:
	http://archives.seul.org/geda/user/Nov-2009/msg00456.html That patch addresses the lack of a RATLINE_TYPE in the
	BuildObjectType function, but does not prevent a segfault for other
	unknown types.

2010-09-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Add new-part-location to import Adds import::newX, import::newY, and import::disperse attributes.
	These determine where new parts are located when they're added to
	the layout, including some random variation to keep them from being
	all on exactly the same spot.  Parameters were added to Import() to
	set these:  In @code{Import()} is called with @code{setnewpoint} then the
	location of new components can be specified.  This is where parts
	show up when they're added to the board.  The default is the center
	of the board.   @table @code  @item Import(setnewpoint) Prompts the user to click on the board somewhere, uses that point.
	If called by a hotkey, uses the current location of the crosshair.   @item Import(setnewpoint,mark) Uses the location of the mark.  If no mark is present, the point is
	not changed.   @item Import(setnewpoint,center) Resets the point to the center of the board.   @item Import(setnewpoint,X,Y,units) Sets the point to the specific coordinates given.  Example:
	  @code{Import(setnewpoint,50,25,mm)}  @end table Note that the X and Y locations are stored in attributes named
	  @code{import::newX} and @code{import::newY} so you could change
	 them manually if you wished.   Calling @code{Import(setdisperse,D,units)} sets how much the newly
	placed elements are dispersed relative to the set point.  For
	example,  @code{Import(setdisperse,10,mm)} will offset each part
	randomly up to 10mm away from the point.  The default dispersion is
	1/10th of the smallest board dimension.  Dispersion is saved in the
	  @code{import::disperse} attribute.

	account that the two silkscreen layers are handled differently.
	Thus, if you tried to select shown silk, you would select hidden
	silk on the other side too, unknowingly moving that around.  With this patch, silk on the far side is only selected if the far
	side ("invisible" side) is shown.

	holes in polygons Having selected polygon hole mode, the first click selects which
	polygon to cut a hole in. A second click defines the start point of
	the hole contour. The tool then behaves in a similar way to the
	polygon drawing tool, with the hole ending when the start point is
	re-clicked.  To avoid creating illegal polygons, the hole drawn is subtracted
	from a representation of the original polygon with the
	poly_Boolean_free().  This consolidates any contours it intersects
	with and prevents the user defining contours which intersect each
	other. (Although we don't currently prevent the the user drawing
	self-intersecting contours).  The resulting POLYAREA is re-processed into PolygonType objects,
	potentially more than one - if the hole drawn bisects the original
	polygon. To keep undo operations simple, these are added as
	completely new objects and the original polygon is deleted - along
	with its ID.

	Support holes in input polygons (incl. file-format addition) PCB file-format date is now 20100606, and files saved with this or
	greater PCB version will not load with older versions of PCB.  If a
	particular board doesn't make use of the polygon hole feature, the
	PCB revision date in the file can be manually reset to 20070407.  The file-format addition is as follows. Previously, a polygon would
	be specified as a series of coordinates, such as: Layer(1 "component") (   Polygon("clearpoly")   (     [6000 6000] [81000 6000] [81000 59000] [6000 59000]   ) ) This commit introduces the ability to specify negative contours
	which form holes in the polygon shape, e.g.: Layer(1 "component") (   Polygon("")   (     [6000 6000] [81000 6000] [81000 59000] [6000 59000]     Hole (       [76000 55000] [76000 38000] [58000 38000] [58000 55000]     )     Hole (       [10000 10000] [10000 28000] [27000 28000] [27000 10000]     )   ) ) The winding order of the contours specified in the file does not
	matter, since PCB will automatically invert the order of the points
	as necessary (as it always did with the outer contour).  Hole contours should not intersect or self-intersect (although this
	isn't checked for at load time). Hole contours must not intersect
	the polygon's outer contour.  Technical details: The PolygonType structure has a number of new fields, the critical
	ones being an array of indices defining the start of hole contours.  (PolygonType *)->HoleIndex[n] The number of hole contours is stored in (PolygonType
	*)->HoleIndexN, and the maximum allocated memory for indices in
	(...)->HoleIndexMax.  The first hole contour starts at the point
	given by (...)->Points[(...)->HoleIndex[0]], and continues until the start of
	the next contour, or the last point defined.  By storing all polygon points (including holes) in the existing
	array (...)->Points[], existing code which operates on the polygon as a
	whole, e.g. translation and rotation, can operate without change.  For other operations, determining wrap-around to operate within the
	same contour requires more computation. Some helper functions have
	been introduced in polygon.c to aid this, next_contour_point() and
	prev_contour_point(). Where applicable, these have been used to
	simplify existing code which used ad-hoc wrap-around code.  polygon_point_idx() computes the array index of a point in a polygon
	from its PointTypePtr address. This is used to replace a search
	idiom used in a number of places. polygon_point_contour() returns
	the number of the contour a given point index belongs in, 0 for the
	outer contour, 1 for the first hole etc..  Undo: Undo with holes has become a little more complex. The undo for a
	point removal must now record which contour the point came from.
	This is determined by the index of the removed point, and a new
	boolean flag "last_in_contour", indicating if the point was at the
	end of its contour.  This flag is passed to InsertPointIntoObject(),
	which uses it to disambiguate inserting a point at an index on the
	boundary of two contours.  Undo operations for removing hole contours "cheat" by saving a copy
	of the whole polygon into the undo buffer rather than attempting to
	describe the operation as a delta change to an existing polygon.
	When undoing, the object IDs are swapped to keep them consistent.

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix node_label() function to work with
	self-intersection Rather than just giving up if we encounter our own edges in the CVC
	list at first, skip them until we either run out of edges, or find
	one belonging to the other polygon.  I'm not 100% sure this is the correct fix, but it "seems to work".  Test-case: Layer(1 "component") (   Line[60000 70000 60000 90000 4000 2000 "clearline"]   Line[80000 60000 80000 90000 4000 2000 "clearline"]   Line[90000 90000 90000 50000 4000 6000 "clearline"]   Line[60000 40000 80000 60000 4000 6000 "clearline"]   Polygon("clearpoly")   (     [10000 10000] [140000 10000] [140000 140000] [10000 140000]   ) )

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix the polygon touching contour test in
	poly_ChkContour The following test-cases were used to help verify the changes: This polygon forms a self-touching shape like this: \|  However, the right-hand edge does NOT have a node at the

2010-06-02   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix poly_ComputeInteriorPoint() to work correctly
	for holes The step where the algorithm finds a convex node to start from must
	take into account whether the polygon vertices are ordered as a hole
	or an outer contour. We now correctly compute a point inside the
	hole, rather than possibly outside it.  This fixes an assertion on the following test-case. Prior to this
	commit, the incorrect "interior" point tested for the concave hole
	happens to lie inside the polygon's other hole, causing it to fail
	an assert during processing.  Layer(2 "solder") (   Line[340000 160000 183700 108000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Line[92000 121000 120000 90000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Line[270000 90000 120000 90000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Polygon("clearpoly")   (     [40000 40000] [320000 40000] [320000 200000] [40000 200000]   ) ) The bug was created in my attempt to speed up poly_ContourInContour:
	commit 3d0a8bd1dae0816d364a774bf9b958faf2983ec7

2010-05-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Speed up poly_ContourInContour() test by computing
	interior point NB: This introduces a behaviour change in the boundary case, that
	two identical contours will now be considered to be inside each
	other.  First perform a test on an arbitrary boundary node (proving that the
	contour being testing for "insideness" is not outside the other
	contour. (This cannot not conclusively prove the contour is inside).  In many cases, this simple node test gives enough evidence to return
	0 for the ContourInContour test computing and testing an interior
	point.  Rather than checking each exterior point, compute a strictly
	interior point (not on the boundary), and test that against the
	second contour.  Benchmarked to improve performance over other fixes for the buggy
	test.  Example board load (CPU) times for a complex board:   21.50 (buggy contour_in_contour - single node point test)   24.43 (brute-force node point tests)   21.79 (single node test, then internal point test)

2010-05-10   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix poly_ContourInContour() test not to return
	TRUE for touching contours This test could previously return true for touching contours, such
	 as: __________....  |_________ |  : :........ ||  : ::  /\  : ||  :
	Note that the bounding box of A is inside that of B, :: /  \ :/  \ :
	such that initial bounding box checks won't reject the ::/ A  \/  B
	\:   possibility of A being inside B.  ::\    /\    /: :: \  / :\  /
	: ::..\/..:.\/..: When testing for insideness, the first point on A's contour is
	picked.  In this case, unfortunately being the touching X point
	between the two contours. This point (correctly) returns as being
	inside B - and the false presumption is that the whole A contour is
	inside B.  This commit introduces an unfortunately slow, but more robust test,
	where we check each node in A for whether it is inside B. We return
	as soon as we find an A node outside B, however this means the test
	is VERY much slower for the case where A _is_ inside B.

2010-05-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Add comment explaining assumptions for
	poly_ContourInContour function Also, document its buggy boundary condition where the arbitrary
	point chosen to test happens to be a common node shared between two
	separate contours (which the test should return FALSE for).

	want.

2010-04-12   Kai-Martin Knaak * kmk AT lilalaser dot de *

	* doc/extract-docs: expand the syntax of documentating comments This is part of the effort to derive the command line option entries
	in the manual dynamically from the source. The expanded syntax
	allows for more control on the actual headings rendered in the
	manual.  1) accept keys enclosed in quotation marks ("). This allows for
	multiple word nodes in the documentation.  2) strip leading digits of the key after sort. This allows to
	control the order of nodes from the source.

	Consolidate hid action parsing.  - Create a common routine hid_parse_command, which handles both
	action script style "action(arg1, arg2);" and command entry style
	"action arg1 arg2".  This is done by making a static
	hid_parse_actionstring function, which takes a boolean to determine
	whether or not it should accept command entry style strings.
	hid_parse_actions functions as it currently does, only accepting
	action script style, but does so by calling hid_parse_actionstring
	with TRUE.  - Use hid_parse_command across all hids for user command entry,
	removing command_parse in lesstif/main.c and batch/batch.c.  - Added extra error handling to common hid_actionv to match
	lesstif_call_action and remove lesstif_call_action.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick
	Bernaud: Add function to register single action.  The possibility to register a single action has been introduced with
	commit 337fa8ba8094cee1ed291cec7bf29895ac7c9d72 but then reverted
	later when changing way of passing context to action callback.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Modify
	HID actions storage.  It removes the HID_ActionNode structure and directly store
	registered actions in an array of HID_Action*.  It also provides a nicer way of making sure the array is sorted and
	the code for binary search within the array has been removed in
	favor of a call to bsearch().

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Set 'exporter'
	global variable before printing defaults.  In print_defaults(), when the HID to print defaults is not a gui,
	set 'exporter' global variable prior to calling HID's
	get_export_options() callback.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Rewrite function
	that print HID options.  The previous version of usage_hid() had a strange search for gui HID
	attributes through 'hid_attr_node' rather than requesting them
	directly from the HID.  As a result it was calling the get_export_options() callback on
	exporter without prior setting of the exporter global variable.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:

	exporting the layout in ghid_dialog_print(): exporter HID relying on
	this variable being set were lost.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Apply
	patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Provide context to callbacks of actions
	through global variable.  Providing a context to action is necessary for scripting languages
	(for example). To do so, a global variable ('current_action') is
	being defined: it is saved, set and restored when running the
	callback of an action in a way similar to what PCB already does with
	HIDs.  The callback function may access the action it belongs to and cast
	it the way it wants to extract information from a potentially
	extended HID_Action structure.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Sort
	actions by references in 'all_actions'.  Previously, when building 'all_actions', a copy of every HID_Action
	was performed for each action. Now it builds 'all_actions' with
	pointers to the actual HID_Action structures (without reallocating).

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/draw.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Modify

	through global variable 'gui'.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:
	Support HID_Mixed options in attribute dialog Since an HID_Mixed attribute is the combination of a real and an

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c:

	code requested insertion of a tab after the name even for HID names
	already exceeding the length of the tabulation.  This is similar to how usage_attr() already does alignment of name
	and help text.

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: Remove invalidate_wh from the new gcode HID
	too.

2010-03-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/main.c, src/misc.c: Remove Settings.init_done
	variable and its usage This variable was previously used to allow action scripts run prior
	to loading the GUI to avoid GUI startup if they executed a "Quit"
	action.  The requirement dates back prior to the HID split, where the "Quit"
	action would cause PCB to call gtk_main_quit(), an operation which
	is illegal if the GUI main loop was not yet started. The init_done
	flag was used in QuitApplication(), both to determine whether the
	GUI had started, and if not - to note that the GUI should not be
	initialised later. (Instead of calling gtk_main_quit()).  With the HID split, the QuitApplication() function was changed to
	call exit(0) rather than gtk_main_quit(), so this dance isn't
	necessary at all now.. in either case, we can just exit the
	application immediately.

	* data/pcb.desktop.in: Revert "As silly as it seems to group any
	sort of scientific or EDA" I've pushed really hard to sort this nonsense out, and this patch is
	not in my opinion suitable for applcation. gEDA, gerbv and PCB all
	deliberately omit the Education category.. this is not where we need
	to fix this issue.  I strongly object to putting bogus categories into our apps.  If
	Debian want to patch these in, let them.  This reverts commit b402a144e19225f0648189bca6fbfad95d046047.

	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Prevent extra windows from showing
	unnecessarily Prevent the library, log, and netlist windows in the GTK HID from
	being shown unless explicitely requested.  This is done by splitting
	ghid_*_window_show into ghid_*_window_create, which creates all the
	resources for the window, and ghid_*_window_show, which actually
	shows the window (and optionally "presents" it, which pulls it to
	the foreground and gives it focus).  Since the NetlistShow action no longer actually shows the netlist
	window, but sets the node/net that is shown in the window (if and
	when it is visible), this patch also adds NetlistPresent which
	presents the netlist window.  This can be added to the
	FindConnections menu item to restore the behavior of bringing up the
	netlist window on a find.  Added an action LogShowOnAppend() which can restore the old behavior
	that the log window is shown whenever something is appended to it
	(currently off by default).

	between arcs and other object. Notes from Ineiev's emails: So I built a montecarlo; fixed some ugly unrealistic cases like thin
	arc merged in bloat and arc->Delta<-360; ran the test program
	(aat.c) several hours on different machins; that discovered no
	errors, though the number of points was not very high (a thousand or
	slightly more): the reference functions are really slow.  That resulted in arc.bis.patch. I tested it also with already
	mentioned teardropped OSDCU.pcb and t1.pcb. Then, eliminate two
	precision losses.  I feel I ought to stop here: the patch fixes many more bugs than
	originally reported.

	* src/hid/png/png.c: Check for empty layers.  If you have a four-layer board but the inner layers are empty, photo
	mode dies.  This checks for at least the more common case, but
	further work to protect against *any* empty layer is warranted.

	* src/hid/png/png.c: Fix photo-mode mask layer.  The addition of mask support to PNG export broke photo mode; this
	patch undoes the mask support when photo mode is enabled.

	* src/hid/png/png.c, src/misc.c: Add support for specifying
	soldermask and solderside from the command line Added "solderside" and "mask" as valid layers for --layer-stack.
	Also added "silk" as an alias for "elements".  Added mask support to
	the PNG exporter so that it draws soldermask properly.  Also added
	support to PNG for showing the board from the solder side, and
	removed some leftover cruft from when it was copied from the PS hid.

	* src/crosshair.c: By popular(*) request, Make the cross-hair snap
	to the center of pads * Popular.. or vocal?, I'm not sure.  If more people don't like the new behaviour, there is always git
	revert.  There was of course, a third possibility - adding support to snap to
	pad end-points _and_ their centers. I rejected this because of
	"nearly" square pads - it becomes difficult to know if you've picked
	up the center of the pad, and many of those asking for
	snap-to-center wanted it in order to pick up and align components by
	their pads.  NB: Optimised rat-lines still go to the edge of pads, as this can
	    often look less cluttered. Rat-lines drawn to the center of a pad
	    will work correctly, and remain on the pad center until the next
	    time "optimise" is run on the rats-nest.

2009-11-15   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/find.c, src/rubberband.c: Add support for rat-lines ending at
	the center of pads Optimised rats are still located at the edges of pads, but the rat
	connection checking code will now also accept rats ending at the
	center of a pad.

	* src/draw.h: draw.h: Remove ClearPin prototype missed in last
	commit

2009-11-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Don't clear pins / vias from polygons... it is
	already done! Our polygons already the required holes for pins, vias, pads etc..
	so don't waste drawing clearances twice. This looks to be a legacy
	from the way PCB used to draw polygons.

2009-11-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c, src/polyarea.h, src/polygon.c,
	src/polygon1.c: polygons: Tag circular contours so they can be
	special-cased when drawing.  Tagging circular contours allows GUIs (if they wish) to draw
	circular holes in polygons more accurately, and potentially faster -
	depending on whether they use mask based rendering or rely on the
	dicer.  When zoomed far out (and using a mask based scheme), the drawing
	routine can use a lower vertex count approximation to the contour -
	leading to rendering speed improvements. This is used to reasonable
	effect in the experimental OpenGL branch.  Modify hid/common/draw_helpers.c to use these tags when thin-drawing
	polygon contours with common_thindraw_pcb_polygon(). This allows the
	GUI to change the level of detail rendered with zoom, and serves to
	test this feature.  DRC checking and output are still done using the fixed resolution
	approximation present in the polygon contour, so in this respect -
	it makes rendering somewhat unfaithful to the final output.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Draw all vias, pins and pads under the mask
	layer This fixes an issue where the rendering of a partially masked via is
	inaccurate. The down-side is that partially, or completely masked
	vias become obscured by the mask drawn above them.  If the user is previewing the mask rendering, it is probably best
	that they see an accurate representation - even if this means hiding
	vias.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Fix thindraw mask drawing for pins, including
	octagonal ones We need to set the line-width for round pins when in thin-draw and
	clearing the mask.  We need to tell DrawSpecialPolygon() whether we need thin-draw or
	not depending on whether we're clearing the mask or not. We don't
	need to set the line-width outside of DrawSpecialPolygon(), since it
	sets it its-self.  Fix DrawSpecialPolygon() to set the line width and cap style on the
	correct GC.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Control update of
	NoHoles cache based on clip region If at least 50% of the bounding box of a polygon is within the clip
	region, compute the whole NoHoles polygon and cache it for later
	rendering.  If less of the polygon is within the clip region, just compute what
	we need to draw the piece we've been asked for.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Fix memory leak in
	polygon NoHoles clipping routine poly_CopyContour creates the edge tree, as does ContourToPoly(),
	which overwrite the one created in poly_CopyContour().  Replace call to ContourToPoly() with a discrete alternative without
	the poly_PreContour() call.  Also, don't try to poly_Free() the output of poly_Boolean_free() in
	an error condition. poly_Boolean_free() re-uses the A input polygon
	for its output, so attempting to free that might be dangerous.  poly_Boolean_free() should free its inputs (and any partial output)
	if it encounters an error.

2009-11-12   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Clip no-holes polygon
	pieces before calling fill_contour This avoids integer overflow in some HIDs (GTK, Lesstif?) when
	drawing at high zoom level. Such overflow would lead to incorrectly
	drawn polygons.  It is possible that a similar bug could effect thin-drawn polygons,
	but that has not manifested its-self so far. If we were to clip
	these in the future, we need to be careful to extend the clip region
	slightly off-screen, so the outlines are not drawn.  Ideally we would clip these vertices using a Sutherland-Hodgman
	clipping algorithm, then we could simply discard edges which are
	clipped completely.

	* src/draw.c, src/hid/common/flags.c, src/hid/gerber/gerber.c,
	src/hid/png/png.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/print.c: Use strcmp() for
	special layer names, rather than strcasecmp() Before commit 086aa491fae18f1ec72da047b772fa3510f72d0b, we were
	using strcmp() and strcasecmp() in different places. That commit
	changed to strcasecmp(). Lets choose to keep the more restrictive
	option for now, which reduces the number of "magic" layer names PCB
	supports.

	* src/draw.c, src/find.c, src/polygon.c: Correct rendering and
	connectivity checks for zero clearance pads and pins NB: These areren't technically allowed by PCB, but it is nice that
	when a user hacks zero clearance in their PCB file, that we: a) Draw polygons without any cleared gaps in the output b) Correctly determine that these objects will be connected to the
	polygon

	* src/polygon.c: polygon.c: Remove unused #define COARSE_CIRCLE 0

2009-11-12   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Speed up unsubtraction from polygons when objects
	are deleted This process worked by adding a new "blob" of polygon to cover in
	the hole made by the object being deleted. If this "blob"
	intersected the contour of the original polygon, it would cause the
	polygon's contour to be damaged. To avoid this, the unsubract code
	would always clip the resulting polygon against the original
	(pristine) polygon contour.  Unfortunately.. this clipping operation is gauranteed to intersect
	the contour of the polygon - a very expensive operation, since all
	holes inside the polygon (many on a complex board) have to be
	re-processed.  This speed-up is achieved by reversing the order of operation. The
	"blob" to be added to the polygon is first clipped against the
	pristine contour (a relatively cheap operation). This then allows us
	to add the new clipped blob to the more complex polygon on the board
	without worry that the contour may be compromised.

2009-11-12   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/file.c: file.c: Add profiling of CPU seconds consumed during
	file load This information is useful to benchmark the load of complex boards
	which consume a lot of CPU cycles clipping polygons during loading.  Adding this upstream will allow me to gain information from users
	describing load slowness, without having a copy their design.

2009-11-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: hid/ps: Don't use diced polygons for postscript
	output This speeds up postscript output on boards with complex polygons.  It has the added advantage for some postscript and pdf readers that
	there are no accidental gaps rendered between pieces of the diced
	polygon due to non-global anti-aliasing in their renderer.

2009-11-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Play with number of line segments in line caps By changing from 36 lines-segments per circle to 40, we create a
	symmetry at 45 degrees - a common angle for lines on a circuit board
	to intersect at. This avoids building additional complexity in the
	polygons which are cut by these intersections.

2009-11-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Fixup frac_circle to avoid repeating a vertex the
	caller will add Before we were getting self-intersecting polygons in some cases, a
	big no-no. One less vertex should be added than the expected
	(CIRC_SEGS / range), since the caller adds the last vertex.

	* src/polygon1.c: polygon1.c: Fixup pline_dump() (debug code) to
	match correct edge state The old code would mistakenly annotate with the edge state for the
	next edge. From polygon1.c: /* note that a vertex v's Flags.status represents the edge defined
	 by * v to v->next (i.e. the edge is forward of v)  */

2009-11-11   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: Re-write node_label() to only label the edge being
	passed as its argument.  Breifly, the old code tried to walk the entire CVCList labeling
	multiple edges. The new code tries only to label the argument vertex
	i.e. the forward ('N') edge from this vertex. It tries to look
	counter-clockwise just one edge which will give the answer in most
	cases. If that fails it looks further into the CVCList until it can
	find the answer, then stops. The code is much simpler because we
	know that the edge we are labeling is always departing the
	cross-vertex point.  (Futher comments and original bug diagnosis by Peter Clifton) This prevents "double labeling", where the old routine could label
	any edges which intersect at the vertex passed to node_label().  This fixes a bug discovered by Stefan Salewski, where certain boards
	could trigger an assert failure when PCB was built with debugging.  The bug, it would seem - is relating to the way (and order) we were
	labeling edges of polygon contours: 2 |/\     In this diagram, x is on the outer contour of our polygon,
	x  |    and is in fact two vertices at the same point, lets denote
	|\/     these as |\ and |/ 1 The labelling algorithm works up from point 1, gets to |\, whereupon
	it gets the CVCList for the spatial point x - which contains |\ AND
	|/ along with the (shared) edges from the clipping contour.  node_label is called with the |\ vertex, but in the process of
	scanning the CVCList at this point, it also checks for SHARED edges.
	It _only_ checks shared edges against the |\ vertex, NOT the |/ one.  During this pass, the | edge coming from the |/ vertex gets
	mis-labelled as "OUTSIDE", where is should eventually get labelled
	"SHARED" BUG: We then skip over calling node_label with the |/ vertex, since | has
	already been labelled. We next get to point 2.  Point 2 looks at the | edge, and declares it to be "INSIDE". (It
	should already have been labelled "SHARED" by this point, so
	node_label doesn't know any better.  The | edge is already labelled "OUTSIDE" when we go to label it
	"INSIDE".. assertion fail.  This commit avoids missing the correct labelling of shared edges, by
	ensuring we never label any edges in advance of calling node_label
	for them.

2009-10-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots: Take a first pass at updating the release
	documentation for git instead of cvs.

2009-10-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* NEWS: Update the target release date for the next snapshot

2009-10-22   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Pass r_NoHolesPolygonDicer a POLYAREA *, not a
	PLINE * No functional changes to callers of NoHolesPolygonDicer() The allows state in the POLYAREA to be passed into the recursive
	dicer. This is needed in order to maintain an up to date r-tree of
	contours in the POLYAREA.

2009-10-22   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix bug with polygon boolean operation PBO_XOR (I
	think!) If the contour in A is outside of B, it should be kept. It seems
	this case may have been missed.  PCB does not use the PBO_XOR operation, so it is difficult to test
	whether this is correct or not.

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/polyarea.h, src/polygon1.c: Make rtree_t type
	available to polygon1.c This saves a load of casting, and helps the compiler doing its job
	catching programming errors.

2009-10-21   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix a bug in gtk hid which caused
	layer buttons to get confused (sourceforge bug 1988951) In ghid_layer_enable_buttons_update, the layer_buttons array was
	being indexed using a counter which stoped at the current max_layer,
	which was wrong.  Changed this to use the constants LAYER_BUTTON_*.  Also made the handling of the silk and rats buttons match the
	(slightly more correct) handling of the other buttons in
	layer_enable_button_cb.

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/create.c, src/global.h, src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c,
	src/mymem.c, src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Add cache for "noholes",
	diced versions of polygons

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c, src/polygon.c: Give callback from
	NoHolesPolygonDicer ownership of the returned contour This means callers of NoHolesPolygonDicer() should call
	poly_FreeContours on the contour they are passed (if they do not
	wish to retain it).

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polyarea.h, src/polygon1.c: Replace poly_Clear(POLYAREA *)
	function with poly_FreeContours(PLINE **) The poly_Clear function only clears the contours of the polygon
	anyway, so make a more explicitly named function to do this work,
	and pass the contours directly.  This will be useful should we want to deal with a series of contours
	separately from a POLYAREA object.

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c, src/create.c, src/strflags.c: Fix "newfullpoly" flag
	test and save its state into the .pcb file.  The flag controlling this behaviour is kept up to date as a PCB
	flag, not something which is updated in Settings.FullPoly. Change
	the test accordingly.  Added a PCB flag "newfullpoly" to save this state in the .pcb file.  NOTE: "full" polygons severly break connectivity checking, as the
	      code always treats broken up pieces of the polygon as being
	connected.        It _might_ have been better to leave this support broken - so       users don't inadvertently create polygons with the "fullpoly"
	      flag.  TODO: Consider removing, hiding or adding warnings to this feature.

2009-10-20   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: hid/gtk: Remove unused function
	in_draw_state()

2009-10-19   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: hid/common: Fix dereference bug in
	hid_find_action().  We want to check context for being NULL, not *context.

2009-10-19   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: hid/common: Don't walk off end of string
	whilst parsing.  Fixed a bug where the action parser would walk off the end of a
	string when given an action without a "(" in it, e.g. "benchmark".

2009-10-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/find.c: Tidy up IsPolygonInPolygon No functional changes

2009-10-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/polygon1.c, src/rtree.c: Add some annotations to
	help optimise branch prediction.  Macros G_LIKELY and G_UNLIKELY were taken from GLib (LGPL 2), and
	renamed without the G_ prefix.  This hasn't had much discernable effect

2009-10-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Rework iteration over contours in "intersect" to
	improve performance We don't need to be using an r_tree search to determine if a
	contour's bounding box hits anything in another contour. Just
	compare the bounding boxes directly, then continue to the more
	expensive testing.  Rather than counting the vertices of each POLYAREA then swapping to
	ensure we loop over the the small one, wait until we've worked out
	which contours we're comparing. Rather than swapping, we just choose
	which to loop over. This saves us time in the case where the larger
	intersecting contour belongs to the polygon with fewer vertices.  In one case, this change reduced a complex board's load time from
	~140 seconds to ~70.

2009-10-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/.gitignore: Add dbus-introspect.h to src/.gitignore dbus-introspect.h is a generated file.

	* src/misc.c: Fix "Design Rule Checker moves elements and traces off
	grid"  Patch from Ineiev * ineiev AT gmail dot com * to keep the grid from
	changing just because DRC ran.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c: Apply filters to load filechooser
	dialogs. [1988982] [2686963] Applies filters to the filechooser dialogs when loading layouts,
	layouts (to buffer), elements (to buffer) and netlists.  Default behaviour is to not filter in the filechooser dialog.
	Choosing a predefined filefilter in the filechooser dialog filters
	on registered mime types, lowercase and uppercase file extensions.
	Predefined filters are selected upon the action chosen in the "File"
	pulldown menu.

2009-08-04   Peter TB Brett * peter AT peter-b dot co dot uk *

	* README.cvs, README.git: Replace 'README.cvs' with 'README.git'.
	[2810417] Provide information on how to use git to access the PCB repository.
	Fixes bug #2810417.

2009-08-04   Peter TB Brett * peter AT peter-b dot co dot uk *

2009-07-30   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: Do not try to call gdImageCreate() on a 0x0
	sized image.  This hopefully addresses some of the segfaults seen recently with
	the latest version of gd.  If a brush size scales to give a size of
	0 then bump it up to a single pixel.

2009-07-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: Check return codes from the various gd
	allocation functions.  Check returns codes for gdImageCreate(), gdImageColorAllocate(), and
	gdImageColorAllocateAlpha() calls to check for problems.

2009-07-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: Don't disperse locked elements.  When dispersing elements do not disperse locked elements.  Locked
	elements often times are mechanical and really should not be moved.

2009-06-19   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Allow quoted strings and escaped
	characters in action arguments.  Quoting works similar to bash quoting: A backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal
	value of the next character that follows.  To get a literal '\' use
	"\\".  Enclosing characters in single quotes preseves the literal value of
	each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur
	between single quotes, even when preceded by a blackslash.  Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of
	all characters within the quotes, with the exception of '\' which
	maintains its special meaning as an escape character.

	* src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Fix command line exporting.  Previously, hid_actionv was changed to always call gui->get_coords
	wether or not the action had a need_coord_msg, in an attempt to
	always get the latest coords for things like zoom or pan that didn't
	have a need_coord_msg.  However, this broke command line exporting
	because it was trying to call get_coords on the nogui hid.  Added the check back in to only call gui->get_coords when the action
	has a need_coord_msg and added need_coord_msg's to actions that need
	coords.

2009-06-08   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Adding ability to customize mouse
	scroll action in GTK.  Changed the mouse_scroll gtk event handler to use do_mouse_action
	instead of manually handling the event.  gtk treats scrolling
	differently as a mouse button event, and doesn't give a mouse button
	number, so this patch just hard codes up/down/left/right to buttons
	4 through 7.  This corresponds to the default names used in the
	resource file, and, for X11, gtk hardcodes mouse buttons 4 - 7 to
	the scrolling events anyway.  This may cause problems in quartz or
	windows if some mouse has a bunch of buttons and quartz/windows maps
	those buttons to numbers 4 - 7, but I don't have a system to test
	that (and in that case the names in the resource file would be wrong
	as well).  Added a Scroll action to the gtk hid to be able to mimic the
	existing scroll wheel behavior with an action script.

	src/hid/ps/ps.c: Adding the ability to use mod1 (alt)(option) in
	HIDs This is useful for OSX installs as crtl-click, is mapped to right
	click.  so when drawing a line that you want to force a DRC
	"Violation" and you need to use the control key, it will cancel the
	line being drawn, and start a new point.  This is tested in the lesstif and GTK hids, under OSX wher ehte
	option key is the "alt" key.   I leave it to the patch integrator th
	verify on linux for GTK and lesstif.  This is a bit hackish on detecting the alt key/option key, I
	#ifdefed it to __APPLE__ because the option key returns 1<<13 not
	GDK_MOD1_MASK Under lesstif I might guess that the alt/mod1 is not
	quite the same as option.

	src/hid/lesstif/main.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Teaching GTK hid to
	use mouse resources I had some free time over the weekend and have been wanting to get
	my hands dirty in the PCB code so I took a crack at this and wanted
	to get some feedback.  Attached is a patch with a detailed commit message of what I did,
	but the general idea was to move the lesstif hid's handling of the
	mouse resources into a common hid file (which I called hid_resource)
	and have the gtk hid use that instead of being hardcoded.  This way
	the hid's are only responsible for catching the button press,
	determining which modifier keys were active, then calling the common
	code to handle it.  The common code does what the lesstif hid does,
	calls the actions defined in the resource file.  In theory more
	common stuff could be moved to hid_resource, the code to find and
	load the resource file, for example, is nearly identical in both
	hids.  I changed up the Mouse resource in gpcb-menu.res to match the
	hardcoded behavior of the gtk hid as closely as possible (see the
	commit message for details).  I've played around with it a bit and it seems to be working, but as
	this my first time meddling with the code, I'm sure I missed some
	stuff.  If anybody has time to look it over and/or try it out that
	would be great.  Comments regarding the approach, formatting, style,
	etc. are all appreciated (I did my best to match the style of the
	surrounding code).  Jared

	* src/edif.y: Use the appropriate header files instead of providing
	extern foo() prototypes.  Use the correct headers for a handful of function prototypes.  This
	should fix some build issues reported on geda-uers.

2009-06-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: When building from git sources and building docs,
	force maintainer-mode.  When building from git sources, maintainer mode is required to build
	the manual.  So, unless the user has specified --disable-doc then
	force maintainer mode.  When building from a tarball, the
	preformatted manual is already contained and we do not impose
	maintainer-mode.  Hopefully this puts to rest the documentation
	building issues once and for all!

2009-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/pcb.pot: Remove generated file that cause continual git churn.  This file is generated and also removed by the clean target.
	Removing a file from the source tree via 'make clean' that is under
	version control just causes headaches.

2009-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/fractional_size.texi, doc/letter_size.texi,
	doc/metric_size.texi, doc/wire_size.texi: Remove additional
	generated files.  Remove the .texi files that are generated from the ASCII .tab files
	from git to avoid gratitous storage of and changing of generated
	files.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/.gitignore, doc/gs/.gitignore: Add a few more missing
	.gitignore entries.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/.gitignore: Expand out the list of files since git didn't like
	the patterns I used.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/.gitignore: Add gitignore file for the manual

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/.gitignore, src/gts/.gitignore: Add some missing .gitignore
	entries for the new gts code

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.cvs: update this a bit to reflect the new repository home
	and also remove references to needing maintainer-mode

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* utils/git2cl: add git2cl utility to help update ChangeLog's for
	releases.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/pcbfile.texi, doc/version.texi: remove some
	generated files from git.  These are only needed if you are building
	the documentation in which case you have all the tools and makefile
	rules for them to be regenrated anyway.  Eliminates all the
	headaches associated with generated files in version control.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/gs/gafrc, doc/gs/gschemrc: these are generated at configure
	time now.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/gs/gafrc.in, doc/gs/gschemrc.in: to handle the case where we
	may be building outside the source directory, generate gafrc and
	gschemrc at configure time.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/gs/print-eps.scm: comment out a color theme that relied on a
	path only present on DJ's machine.  It isn't really needed anyway.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/POTFILES.in: add a missing file.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, doc/gs/Makefile.inc,
	lib/Makefile.am: Remove the use of maintainer mode to gate on/off
	rules for building the documentation.  Instead look for the
	existance of $(top_srcdir)/.git and decide based on that if this is
	a tarball build (in which case the documentation ships already
	built) or a git build.  If it is a git build, then simply require
	all the needed tools for building the docs.  If the tools are not
	found then configure will exit with an explicit message saying why
	it has failed and that either tools need to be installed or
	--disable-doc needs to be given.  Hopefully this will eliminate the
	previous strange behavior of needing --maintainer-mode when building
	docs from cvs/git.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am: add gts/predicates_init.h to DISTCLEANFILES.
	Also comment out the section that extracts REGISTER lines from the
	gts code.  We currently don't have any REGISTER lines in the gts
	code and so make was exiting because a grep failed.

2009-05-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc, lib/to.inc: Add TO18, TO39, and fix pinout on TO92.  Added TO18 and TO39 footprints based on the JEDEC drawings.  Note
	that the pinout used is the one from the JEDEC drawings and it may
	or may not match a particular vendors pin numbering.  I have in fact
	seen different vendors number the pins differently on these
	packages.  It is entirely up to the user to make sure that their CAD
	symbols have the correct mapping from E, B, C (for a bipolar) to
	pins 1, 2, 3 and that the JEDEC numbering is used.  While here correct the TO92 pinout.  It now also matches the JEDEC
	drawing and is more consistent with the most common vendor
	numberings.  How on earth has this not caused problems before?

2009-05-17   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/hid/lpr/hid.conf: Some cleanup of
	configure script Added top level check for pkg-config with PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG and
	removed AC_PATH_PROG call for pkg-config from inside a block
	conditional on enable_dbus.  Added a PKG_CHECK_MODULE for cairo if the toporouter output is
	enabled.  Added a check for HID dependencies.  A hid's hid.conf can set a
	variable "deps" which is a list of other HIDs that must be included
	with that hid.  Added ps the lpr's deps.

2009-05-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh: Remove an extra '' quote in a comment
	which caused confusion on some systems.

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/gts/cdt.c,
	src/toporouter.c, src/toporouter.h: Toporouter: portability fixes 1) add #include <assert.h> 2) add configure options for toporouter --disable-toporouter
	switches off toporouter --disable-toporouter-output switches off
	toporouter cairo output 3) make toporouter compatible with glib < 2.10.0 provide
	slist_insert_sorted_with_data() for those cases 4) fix VPATH builds gts/predicates_init stuff was not quite clean 5) fix find_closest() implementation for glib < 2.4.0 The earlier
	version combined with toporouter produced segfault on tut1.pcb (on
	top of glib-2.0.1 and glib-2.6.4); furthermore, it accessed to
	undocumented glib structures.

	* src/polygon.c: Allow PolygonHoles() to be passed a NULL region Passing a NULL region implies we wish to be called back for all

	directly (if it wants), rather than being called to display ordinary
	message dialog boxes. No HID yet utilises this interface.  Remove log messages for individual design rule violations, instead
	writing log entries based on the title in the DrcViolationType. This
	modifies some of the logged messages slightly. All now prefix:

2009-02-10   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: polygon1.c: Implement poly_Boolean() by calling
	poly_Boolean_free() Reduces duplicated code. The poly_Boolean() implemetation already
	copied the original contours, then duplicated the processing steps
	taken in poly_Boolean_free().

2009-02-08   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: gtkhid: Return NULL from
	ghid_get_net_from_node_name() Fixes calling return; from function returning non-void type.

2009-02-08   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/crosshair.c: crosshair.c: When drawing via DRC clearence, pass
	correct angle.  360 * 64 was a hold-over from before the HID split. The passed angle
	should be 360.

2009-01-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h, src/rats.c: Make rats to polygons
	work for arbitrary clipped shapes The rat will still be drawn to the first point on the polygon, which
	might not necessarily be the closest.

2009-01-14   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Handle wrap-around when searching the string hash
	table.

2009-01-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: for the axial footprints, put the mark on pin 1
	instead of on the body of the footprint.  This gives you a much
	better chance of the pins being on-grid when working with the
	coarser grids typically found in a thru-hole design.

2008-12-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/polygon.c: Add description of how polygon data works from Ben,
	and debug routines for dumping polygon structures within gdb.

	before.

2008-12-27   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: sf patch 2162834 from d.ineiev - count

	files.

2008-12-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Fix off-by one error in the GTK
	HID's netlist window model generation Broken when I added support for a hierarchical view of nets. The bug
	caused invalid memory to be read, possibly leading to a crash, as
	the last (and missing) element from g_new0 was supposed to be a
	terminator.

2008-12-21   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid.h: append '-' on all parameter names to prevent
	mis-interpretation of such.  Example: "xor" is a C++ reserved name.

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Increase resolution of gerbers to 0.01
	mil; drills remain at 0.1 mil

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/parse_l.l: Add support for suffixes on numbers, like "mm",
	"um", "in", or "mil".  No suffix defaults to "pcb units" as before.

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/flags.c: Add flags for whether various layers are shown.

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Add MinClearGap() action.

2008-12-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: try to clean up the logic around cross compiling and
	an executible pcb.  Hopefully addresses some corner cases when cross
	compiling.

2008-12-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/version.texi, lib/Makefile.am,
	lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: use if FOO  stuff endif instead of 	 @FOOTRUE@ stuff as the latter prevents automake from properly understanding some
	dependencies.

2008-12-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi: regen

2008-12-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am,
	lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh: Correctly deal with the case where one wants
	to do a maintainer cross compile which requires an installed pcb
	that can be executed on the build host.  As part of this, also do
	not build the png previews of the pcblib-newlib library by default.
	They were not really used for anything and it really slows the
	build.  They can be built with --enable-m4lib-png.

2008-12-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: check for windres as a build tool
	instead of hard coding 'windres'.  Should help with cross-compiling
	with windows as the target.  Noted as a patch for gerbv by Cesar
	Strauss.

2008-12-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2008-11-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am: honor psdir, pdfdir, docdir, htmldir, dvidir.
	Noted in sf bug #1916057.

2008-11-27   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/create.c: Test the two lines, not the line vs the current pcb,

2008-11-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: do not free() the result of getenv().  Noted by Peter
	Clifton

2008-11-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/global.h, src/hid/common/hidinit.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c, src/main.c: 
	Determine the users home directory on program startup and remember
	it for use in other places later.  This avoids repeated use of
	getenv("HOME") which may have issues especially under windows.

2008-11-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: create a DOS batch file wrapper for the installer
	to make it easier to run the installer immediately after building it
	from the cygwin shell.  Without this, vista doesn't seem to like to
	run it for some reason.

2008-11-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/Makefile.am, win32/build_pcb, win32/extract_gtk_win32,
	win32/pcb.nsi.in, win32/registerExtension.nsh: - various minor updates for a more recent download of gtk and
	  friends largely taken from gerbv.  - associate .pcb and .fp file extensions with pcb - make sure we start up pcb in the My Documents area to discourage   writing into Program Files.

2008-11-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/POTFILES.in: add 2 missing files that have translations

2008-11-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/create.c: Don't merge two lines if the join flag differs.

2008-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-pinout-preview.c: Fix preview drawing broken by
	resetting "Gathering" mode after painting.  Seems that the pinout preview widget relied on the bug fixed in
	commit 0647d028e6c755715d2fcdbd0b4f2be73d36ae7f. In the expose
	handler of the preview, We should be calling the
	hid_expose_callback() function rather than DrawElement() directly.

2008-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Remove logged warning when
	pressing a key with no defined binding Poping up the log window in these cases is very intrusive, and it
	triggered for keys such as capslock, Mod4/Windows etc. There is no
	real need to log errant key-presses, so remove this feature.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/autoroute.c, src/mtspace.c: Fix two assertion test to allow
	compiling a debug build.  Due to code-restructures, a couple of assert tests (not normally
	compiled) had bit-rotted. Remove one, rejig the other.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: rtree.c: Fix typo in assertion test inside __r_search Caused false assertion failures when running a debugging build.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/search.c: Fix IsPointInBox to work with wide as well as tall
	boxes Actually implement the test, rather than trying to construct a pad
	to test which has the right geometry.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: Change rtree penalty function in rtree.c to use
	doubles, not long long.  Since the exact integer result doesn't matter, this is ok.
	Marginally faster on Core Duo machine.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: Check all r-tree node children for fit before working
	out penalties Working out the penalty involves multiplications which produce a
	"long long" result, and is seen to be appear in profiling.  Make a pass at testing all children for the fast case of the child
	node containing the desired box, before working out size penalties
	to expanding each child.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/heap.c: Increase initial heap size from 32 to 256 In complex boards with lots of polygons, we were realloc'ing up to
	this kind of number anyway, in x2 size steps. Save all the
	memcpy'ing by making the heap larger to start with.  My test board still has some requirement for heaps >256, <512, but
	the frequency is low.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: GTK HID: Raise already open command
	window to top with ":" key Previously, ":" only opened the window, but would not raise it if
	already open.

2008-10-02   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/move.c: Fix array index out of bounds over layer groups Off by one error in for loop, picked out by a recent version of GCC
	being better at spotting this kind of bug. The effects (if any) this
	bug caused are unknown.

2008-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: GTK HID: Fix crash when
	highlighting connectivity caused by net tree.  Seems I caused a crash in the connectivity highlighting code which
	assumed the net model of in the netlist window is a list structure
	where each element represents a net. Adapted the code to hunt out
	the right net / node with a tree model of nets.

2008-10-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots, utils/cvs2cl.pl: add a local coyp of cvs2cl.pl

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Don't bother unsubtracting complex
	polygons when doing incremental updates Since the polygon is re-cleared against any objects existing within
	the bounding box of the update region, there is no point wasting CPU
	cycles intersecting a more complex polygon than necessary. Just take
	the UNION of the polygon being unsubtracted, and the bounding box of
	the hole to be filed in.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c, src/polygon.c: Fix text bounds to include the area
	cleared into a polygon Fixes re-clearing the polygon when a closely touching object is
	incrementally updated.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Ensure "Gathering" mode is set after painting the
	screen.  In between repaints initiated from the GUI, with this flag set, all
	Draw{object_type} operations just update a dirtied bounds. A final
	Draw() call then calls the HID to invalidate the bounds gathered.  Setting "Gathering = True" after an expose event callback ensures
	subsequent drawing is batched up for the next screen update.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Add debugging code to visually check a pad's bounding
	box Proved useful in fixing the pad bounding box update routine.
	Disabled with #if 0 block.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c, src/move.h: Fix bounding boxes for rotated square
	ended pads.  Bounding box compution only worked for round ended pads before.  In
	addition, the "move" code previously called SetLineBoundingBox for
	pads, which computes the wrong result.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-library-window.c: GTK HID: Make double clicking on
	a footprint library expand / contract it Usability improvement.

	* src/buffer.c: Put exploded pads on the correct layer

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Display nets as a hierarchical
	tree in the netlist window.  The view splits netnames at "/" characters, and builds the netlist
	view as a tree accordingly. Allows more strutured viewing of nets
	coming from hierarchical designs.

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Improve hashing algorithm for storing
	color data Curosry testing showed the old algorithm encountered a lot of hash
	collisions. Swap to a more sensible hashing algorithm.

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Fix lru heuristic to shortcut color
	cache lookup Heuristic didn't work before as the lru element wasn't saved.

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/batch/batch.c: Fix batch HID by adding stub functions for

	is the reverse of DJ's.

2008-07-08   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	magic "M48" for detection of excellon drill files.

2008-05-07   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Don't say ,TZ as we're not omitting
	trailing zeros.

2008-04-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/mtspace.c, src/report.c: fix a few more code before
	declarations bugs.  Patch by der Mouse.

2008-04-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: if the compiler takes it, turn on code before
	declarations warnings

2008-04-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/edif.y, src/puller.c: Fix some code before declarations bugs
	noted by der Mouse.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c: Applied patch from Tomaz Solc fixing crosshair
	issues with ActionNew() ActionNew() function didn't call a RestoreCrosshair() after a
	HideCrosshair() in most cases.  This causes symptoms similar to those described in #1900255 when
	"Start new layout" is selected in the File menu in GTK HID (most
	probably also in Lesstiff, but I haven't checked).  This patch adds two missing RestoreCrosshair() calls and fixes that
	issue.  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c: Applied patch from Tomaz Solc fixing a bug in the
	CenterDisplay function.  This patch fixes a bug in the CenterDisplay function that doesn't do
	a RestoreCrosshair() after HideCrosshair().  This causes the crosshair stack overflow when using the DRC checker
	(which calls CenterDisplay a lot).  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/crosshair.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Applied patch
	from Tomaz Solc fixing bug #1882970.  This patch fixes a bug where objects attached to the cursor (line
	segments during drawing, etc.) permanently disappear if mouse cursor
	leaves a window during dragging.  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Apply patch from Igor to ensure when
	flipping the board, the cursor remains on the same point on the
	layout. Thanks!

	src/hid/png/png.c, src/hid/ps/eps.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add HID hook,
	close_confirm_dialog() for closing modified layouts.  This allows GUI HIDs to present a more native looking "save before
	closing" dialog. The HID is responsible for any save which the user
	requests and the subsequent return codes from the HID are as before,
	0 for cancel and 1 for close.  This checkin also fixes the GTK HID's Save() action to return 1 for
	cancel if the user cancels from the "Save As" dialog.

2008-04-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: Fix off-by-one bug drawing pads.

2008-03-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/misc.c: If a layer selected through --layer-stack isn't found,
	let the user know and print a list of available layers.

2008-03-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Ignore zero-radius filled circles.

2008-03-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c, src/parse_y.y: Only use the min annular ring parameter
	for checking the annular rings on pins and vias.  Previously the
	minimum copper width setting was also used.  Changed after a
	discussion on geda-user.  Also make sure we use the minimum copper
	width as the default if the .pcb file doesn't specify the minimum
	annulus.

2008-03-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Add a missing terminating '*' on the
	first G04 line of the output files.  Noted on #geda.

2008-02-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am: revert most of the previous commit which
	accidentally added some stuff that was not meant to be checked in.

2008-02-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/pcbtest.sh.in: use absolute paths (set at
	configure time) so this script may be called from other directories
	as part of a test suite.

2008-02-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add 128 pin 14x14 mm LQFP with exposed padded.  Add
	128 pin 14x14 mm TQFP with and without exposed paddle

2008-01-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: use tr to kill the extra \r that end up in the
	Makefiles courtesy of pkg-config.  This builds all but the docs on
	windows again.

2008-01-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid.h,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: avoid segfaults on loading certain
	boards from the command line.  This patch introduces a flag that
	indicates when the gui is up and calls to ghid_shift_is_pressed()
	and ghid_control_is_pressed() can proceed as normal.

	licenses to the installer.

2008-01-29   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* icon-theme-installer: Fix bug in icon-theme-installer where the
	-?? size was not stripped from the installed icon name.

2008-01-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/flags.c, src/gpcb-menu.res, src/pcb-menu.res: Repair the

2008-01-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: After we run DRC, force a redraw since we've possibly
	turned on and off layers (like silk).  Should address SF bug
	1843181.

2008-01-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* autogen.sh: drop the intltool required version to 0.35 as that
	seems to work

2008-01-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, data/Makefile.am, icon-theme-installer: 
	check for gtk-update-icon-cache and use it.  For distcheck, disable
	that via setting the GTK_UPDATE_ICON_CACHE_BIN to 'true' to avoid
	creating a cache file which then is not removed.  A better way would
	probably be a uninstall hook which noticed that it was a distcheck
	uninstall and simply removed the file.

	placeholders anyway.  Remove the rules for regenerating these
	obsolete icons.

2008-01-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* data/Makefile.am, icon-theme-installer: Remove the use of
	#!/bin/bash for the benefit of systems which don't install bash in
	/bin.  In the Makefile, call out the name of the shell to help
	systems like solaris where it is more likely that SHELL will be
	/bin/ksh instead of the broken solaris /bin/sh

2008-01-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* autogen.sh: Check for the version of intltool.  Also apply some
	fixups to the po/Makefile.in.in file created by intltoolize.

2008-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.am: it helps if we build libintl before using it...

2008-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: add missing $INTLLIBS to LIBS.  Fixes building with
	lesstif and batch.

2008-01-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: check for and include

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: be a little smarter about parsing
	the hotkey parts of the menu resource file.  Now give a sane message
	instead of segfaulting on a malformed input.  Also check for
	duplicate hot keys and drop the duplicates with a message.

2008-01-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: correctly scale the step sizes

	* src/hid/bom/bom.c: Fix a problem with the X-Y output file where

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: Check for Xrender library.

2007-12-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: Sometimes single-point touching will leave no
	starting point on the 'A' pline for an ISECTED contour. Check for
	starting points on the 'B' pline (only at the point of intersection)
	just in case it has a valid starting point.

2007-12-04   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	background/erasures transparent

2007-12-03   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/crosshair.c: Avoid moving elements snapping to their own pins
	or pads.  Don't snap moving vias to any kind of pins (they can't
	overlap anyway).

2007-12-03   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Don't create empty text objects.

2007-12-02   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/misc.c, src/polygon.c: Data->LayerN should generally be
	avoided.  It's not initialized for buffers.  All buffers should have
	max_layer available (which is a macro for PCB->Data->LayerN, the
	number of layers in the current board).

2007-12-02   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Partial fix? [ 1775101 ] Undo with the line tool

2007-11-27   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/rats.c: Fix two bugs in my via-rats patch: 1)  Certain combinations of objects (presumably rare!) could lead to

	when "draw outline" is selected.  Make alignment marks less
	obtrusive.  Make drill helpers half the board's minimum drill size,
	not twice PCB's minimum drill size.  Include commented out helpers
	for brass paste stencil etching.

2007-11-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/undo.c: Don't just clean out RemoveList, free it, so it's
	created properly later.

2007-11-25   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/polyarea.h: Add some prototypes for global functions returning
	double that will confuse the heck out of you if treated as returning

2007-11-23   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/autoroute.c: LIST_LOOP works on circular lists, but at least
	some code will produce a head pointer of NULL for an empty list,
	causing LIST_LOOP to crash.  Since I'm not sure which is the bug, I
	changed LIST_LOOP to assert() on a NULL list head and skip the loop.
	With assert disabled, the loop becomes a no-op, which seems
	appropriate.

	* src/change.c, src/change.h, src/move.c, src/polygon.c,
	src/rotate.c, src/strflags.c: Add support for clearing text from
	polygons.  Text with the clearline flag (set with the J key by
	default, just like lines and arcs) will have a rounded rectangle
	hole cut in any overlapping polygons.

2007-11-04   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Shift-click with the via tool to connect it to the
	current layer as you place it.

2007-11-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: Don't draw pins/holes on the outline layer.  Include
	commented-out code to put board outline on mask layers, for fabs
	that need that.

2007-11-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/buffer.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c,

	* src/action.c: Fix printf format warnings.

2007-10-21   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/crosshair.c, src/draw.c, src/rats.c: Ratlist generation is
	changed to favor connecting to polygons when they are available and
	surround the pin needing a connection.  Such rats are still
	internally lines to the corner of the polygon, but have the VIAFLAG
	set.  The drawing code is modified to show them as little donuts
	(suggesting the via that would be used to connect the pin, vs a
	line).  The crosshair rubberband code is modified to NOT draw these
	lines while dragging.  These changes are forward and backward
	compatible.

2007-10-21   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/find.c, src/find.h: Make DRC dialog
	next/continue to clarify its function.  When DRC is over, message
	now indicates if it was cancelled (so log can distinguish lack of
	DRC errors from aborted DRC).

2007-10-20   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/rubberband.c: The correct point on a line now moves with a
	polygon (fix cut'n'paste typo) When you move a line endpoint, only
	*exactly* connected lines go with you.  When you move a line, if
	another segment fully overlaps the end of the moving line, the
	entire segment (not an arbitrary end of it) will move.  When you
	move an element, any segments completely covered by a pad move with
	the pad.  (there are still some bugs in the drawing code as you
	drag??)

2007-10-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix some really broken spurious panning
	of the drawing area which happens when the board is viewed from the
	back.  Reported by Peter Clifton who also helped getting this patch
	working right.

2007-10-04   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Reject double and triple clicks
	in ghid_port_button_press_cb() Fixes a bug where a component would be rotated by more steps than
	desired if clicking quickly with the rotate tool.

2007-09-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/polygon.c: Change rendering of rounded corners used when
	clearing polygons.  This fixes a slight rotation in rounded
	rectangles and asymmetry of all rounded clearances besides complete
	circles (which were not affected by the bug).  For an illustration,
	see:  http://ad7gd.net/geda/roundrectanim.gif (include error code
	print in returns from the polygon code -- not much use)

2007-09-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/autoroute.c: Add (under ifdef) code I used to debug a report
	of "The rats nest is stale! Aborting autoroute...".  It leaves the
	rat in question selected after the error.

2007-09-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: add missing 2007 in copyright year (for all the gtk
	usermenu stuff)

2007-09-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: avoid free()-ing some memory a bit
	too soon.  Patch from Ineiev.

2007-09-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/pcb-menu.res: use mil and mm instead of

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Add missing else.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/buffer.c: Fix bugs with undoing "group" moves of objects over
	a polygon.  The group code uses the buffer code (sort of an
	automatic cut/paste) so it applies to inserting elements and using
	the buffers as well.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Fix [ 1751568 ] shorted nets stay orange after

	* src/rotate.c: Fix [ 1751574 ] undoing rotation that put an elt
	inside a poly didn't fix plow Properly restores/clears rubber band
	lines during rotate and undo.  Still shockingly slow if you try this
	on an even moderately full board!

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/find.c, src/rtree.h: Search for rat-end connections using 3x3
	"fat" ends to avoid having rat-to-polygon-corner connections missed.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/select.c: Fix [ 1751566 ] When 'far side' hidden, hidden
	elements don't deselect Change the SelectBlock to ignore visibility
	for deselect while looping over all elements.  The diffs are large
	because the original code used VISIBLE_*_LOOP so all of the looping
	was replaced.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/search.c: Apply [ 1751580 ] polys should not be
	selectable/considered when thin-drawn

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/search.c: Fix the crash from [ 1724453 ] PCB Crashes with bad
	footprint (in its library) Does not fix whatever bug in the input
	allowed a bogus element in (see bug for description of the problem
	with the element and the source of the bad element).

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/remove.c: Fix bugs 1751572 and 1743534 by allowing a remove on
	an endpoint to delete the segment if it's not just deleting a kink
	from a longer line.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/move.c: Fix [ 1751578 ] 'move to current layer' doesn't
	re-plow polygon correctly by clearing the NEW line pointer instead
	of the old (destroyed) one.

2007-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/dil.inc: Patch [ 1784693 ] Fix Mark position for SDIP packages

2007-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: Add newlib/keystone/Makefile.  Forgot to

	* newlib/Makefile.am, newlib/Makefile.in,

	newlib/keystone/Makefile.in: add Keystone SMT battery holder for

2007-09-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in, lib/candk.inc, lib/common.m4,
	lib/nichicon.inc, lib/optek.inc: Add C&K ES series switches, Optek
	white LED, and Nichicon WT series of SMT electrolytics.

2007-09-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: gut
	ghid_print_dialog() and use the attribute editor to do all of the
	dialog box work.  Removes a bunch of duplicated code.

	src/hid/png/png.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/vendor.c: Add a
	->fileselect() function to the HID interface.  Now actions can use
	gui->fileselect() instead of gui->prompt_for() when they are
	specifically looking for a file.  Currently the gtk HID implements
	this and the lesstif one has the old behaviour.  While messing around with dialogs, add a "descr" argument to the
	attribute editor.  That can be used as a tooltip, help string, or
	ignored.

2007-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Fixed .ps output with "drill-copper" and
	"drill-helper" options.  Holes in the soldermask (and other non-copper layers) are now drawn
	correctly when the "drill-copper" option is set to false. With the
	"drill-helper" option on, only holes on copper layers are affected.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c,

	* doc/pcb.texi: clean up the regexp appendix a bit

2007-08-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2007-08-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Teach the GTK HID

2007-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: add missing save_syntax and save_help.
	Also allow Save(PasteBuffer) so we have more compatibility with the
	lesstif HID.  This also fixes the regression about saving buffer
	elements which appeared after the user menu branch was merged.

2007-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	intentional.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add option "drill-copper" to draw / not draw
	drill holes in the copper layers of the ps exporter. This is useful
	for plated through processes which require the etch mask to protect
	the vias / pins during etching.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Change drawing code for square pads to use
	gui->fill_rect (...) as on Win32, the current method of drawing a
	zero length line doesn't work.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Stop far side 'invisible' pads being drawn when pins /
	pads are switched off.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix drawing of filled rectangles when

2007-05-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c, src/main.c:

2007-05-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: if the popen fails for the ListLibraryContents.sh
	shell script, continue on with the newlib processing instead of
	failing.  This helps on systems where either the user has disabled
	m4 libraries or on systems like windows where the popen will not

2007-05-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/connector.inc: Increase the hole size on the DIN* connectors
	(are these named wrong btw?) from 28 mils to 40 mils.  This is more
	in line with what is recommended for Tyco *-1634689-* box headers in
	Tyco drawing 1634689.  Noted by Seb James.

2007-05-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c: When refusing to create overlapping vias spit out a
	warning.  We should probably allow overlapping vias but turn it into
	a DRC violation.  But until then, at least give a warning instead of
	silently dropping them.  More details are in bug reports: [ 1687692

2007-05-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	  with the same rotation as in the layout.  Besides being more useful
	  this avoid a segfault in some cases.

	src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Teach the GTK HID how to trap certain hotkeys
	which gtk usually captures for its own use.  This lets PCB use the
	arrow keys and the tab key again.  So restore the hotkey for
	flipping sides in the menu resource file.  Start on the Cursor()
	action which is needed for the arrow keys.  That part is not done
	yet.

2007-04-28   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: Don't double the pad thickness when restoring to
	the polygon.  For speedup, just add back a simple rectangle since it
	only has 4 points. Should do that for lines too, but didn't.

	src/todo: Merge the usermenu branch.   This reworks how the menus
	and hotkeys are defined and handled for the gtk HID.  In particular,
	instead of being hard coded, the menus are loaded from a menu
	resource file like in the lesstif gui.  All hotkeys are defined via
	the menu hotkeys and thus are visually presented in the menus.  The
	gtk HID looks for "gpcb-menu.res" instead of "pcb-menu.res" so that
	the menu organization may be different between the lesstif and gtk
	HID's.

	positive Y is down) from me.

2007-04-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/parse_y.y: turn on the code which
	marks the file format version in the file.  pcb has had the code in

	version of pcb is not new enough to read the current file version.

2007-04-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: prevent the

2007-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/flags.c: Change the stringflag in the settings from showdrc to

2007-03-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: Fix a bug when looking for square pad to square pad
	clearance.  The old way simply grew one of the pads by Bloat on all
	4 sides and looked for overlap.  This is not the correct test in the
	case where the closest line between the two pads is a unique line

	to hold PCB flags.  Added hash table for parameter lookup in action.c Moved thindraw code out of lesstif hid.  Added "thin draw polygons" flag to toplevel stuff.  Fixed "check polygons" so it works again.  Added "lock names" setting: When set, the arrow tool ignores element
	names and text objects, so you can select the elements or objects
	beneath them.  Added "only names" setting: When set, the arrow tool can only select
	element names and text objects; you won't accidentally move an
	element.  Made the crosshair-move code draw the outline of pads, not the
	centerline.  It does still draw round-end pads as rectangles,
	though.  Allow "--no-foo" to shut off boolean "--foo" options that default to
	on.  Added "--layer-stack" option that takes a string and sets the layer
	stack to it (for eps/png export, mostly).  Layers are numbers
	0..N-1, the names of the layers from the loaded PCB file, or the
	special names "rats", "invisible", "pins", "vias", or "elements".
	Layers may be separated by spaces, commas, semicolons, or colons.  Added Display(Step,[1..9]) to move the cursor in steps.  Implemented
	in lesstif HID, attached to arrow keys.  Added "what to do with the
	pointer" parameter - warp pointer to match crosshair, or pan window
	to put crosshair under cursor.  Make autorouter show live trials.  Clean up various FIXMEs.  Add support for string encoded PCB flags.  thindraw exports: off by default?  Follow current setting?  Or put
	it in their own attribute list? Added Report(NetLength) which reports on the total length of
	segments (lines and arcs) for the net under the cursor.  It will
	also tell you the name of the net.  Remove obsolete UseLogWindow and RaiseLogWindow.

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/Pcb.ad.in, src/Pcb.ad.raw,

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, src/main.c: if we somehow fail to find

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi: regen

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Modify how the dependencies work
	a bit for the newlib library that is generated from the m4
	libraries.  In particular, make sure that a normal user building
	from a tarball doesn't have to build the libraries since they take
	quite a bit of time.  Also make sure things work with a read-only
	source tree.

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: When pcb is called with no path, i.e. "pcb" instead of
	"../src/pcb" or /usr/local/bin/pcb, then we can't just look at
	argv[0] to figure out the installation path.  In this situation,
	search through PATH to find which pcb was called.  Should fix
	problems noted on geda-dev by Tomaz Solc.

	Take a stab at making pcb installations be relocatable.  By this I
	mean you can configure and install with ./configure --prefix=/original/path make make install mv
	/original/path /new/path and still have pcb work.  To make this work, the binary path is determined at runtime and all
	of the other paths are computed relative to this.  As part of this, go ahead and kill off the pcb wrapper script around
	pcb-bin.  That was leftover from Xaw days and wasn't really needed
	anymore.  As a side effect, the --program-prefix and
	--program-suffix configure options will probably work now.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* acinclude.m4, config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: add autoconf
	macros from
	http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/adl_compute_relative_paths.html and
	http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/adl_normalize_path.html and use them
	to find relative paths from $bindir (where the pcb binary gets
	installed) to the directories with the default font and the
	footprints.  This is the first step in making an installation be
	relocatable.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c: - Instead of tying the saving of preferences to the autobackup
	timer, save them when we press ok on the preferences form.  - Move the autosave code out of the gtk hid and put it in the core.
	  Now autosave should work on all gui's instead of just the gtk one.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Add a "find" and "rip-up" button

	mailing list.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h, src/file.c: Instead of writing the backup file
	always to /tmp/something derive a backup name from the pcb file name
	(if the pcb file name exists, otherwise use PCB.%i.save in the
	current directory).  This should make it easier to find the backup
	file for a particular layout and also helps in cases where /tmp is
	not appropriate (windows).

2007-01-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: add some code showing how to get the

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Fix a bug in
	GTK hid that causes the view port to scroll in a random direction on
	a mouse click inside the view port (for example when drawing a
	line).  This bug only shows itself when an X application that steals window
	focus is running together with PCB on the same X server. At least
	GNOME and XFCE window managers are known to do that.  See the following and related GNOME bugs for some discussion about
	this: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102209 See also GTK documentation for GtkWidget and GdkEvent.  Analysis and patch provided in patch [ 1610717 ] Patch for auto-pan

2006-11-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/parse_l.l, src/parse_y.y: Add code to
	the parser which looks for a line like FileVersion[20061101] at the top of the .pcb file.  If this line is seen and indicates a
	version which is too new for this version of pcb then issue a
	complaint and explain why.  This should help out when the file
	format changes and someone tries to load a new design with an older
	version of pcb.  Of course the real benefit won't happen until
	versions of pcb prior to this check all go away...  For now, the actual output file from pcb hasn't changed.  There is a
	two line change to include the FileVersion[] line that can be
	included the next time the file format is changed.  However, there
	is no reason to not have the program start watching for it.

2006-11-10   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	pointer in data structure.

2006-11-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add several more media types and for the existing

	internal resolution that the old values.

2006-11-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/change.c, src/change.h, src/const.h,
	src/draw.c, src/find.c, src/strflags.c: Add a 'nopaste' flag for
	pads.  This lets you produce fiducial marks that should not have
	solder paste.  In addition you can use it for things like card edge
	connectors where you may not want solder paste.  Since this is
	moderately dangerous (how do you make sure you don't set this flag
	somewhere where you _need_ solder paste), the drc check reports a
	count of how many times this flag is used.

	assumes the Data is the loaded PCB which doesn't work during file
	reading.

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c, src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Cast the char's
	which are being fed to isspace() and friends to ints which is what
	they want.

2006-10-20   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: check the coming regions, not the one we're at over
	and over

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: add a
	couple of casts and kill the rest of the remaining gcc and SunPRO
	warnings!

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: cast to a size_t before converting
	callback data between ints and pointers

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-icons-misc.data, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: 
	remove some SunPRO compiler complaints about initilizers being out
	of range

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: catch HID_Mixed in a switch

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/bom/bom.c, src/hid/gerber/gerber.c, src/print.c: avoid gcc
	warnings when using %c with strftime

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: #ifdef DEBUG out a couple of things which are
	defined but not used unless DEBUG is defined

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/draw.c: cast to a size_t before an int when passing an int to
	a callback function.

2006-10-19   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: even faster tree searching and insertion

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: modify the DEBUGP macro slightly so it can be
	legally called with only one argument like DEBUGP("\n");

2006-10-19   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: oops, don't manage the contour bounding boxes in
	the tree

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: {T,}QFN16_3{,_EP} needs to use PKG_QFN_50S not
	PKG_QFN_50.  Noted by Matthias Wenzel.

2006-10-18   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: speed up hole insertion further. Trees everywhere!

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: Only apply the -rdynamic check if we're
	using gcc.  This probably isn't the correct long term fix but for
	now it lets users with SunPRO build again.  The problem is -rdynamic
	with SunPRO's cc doesn't have the same behaviour as with gcc but it
	returns 0 so configure thinks it is ok to add -rdynamic.

2006-10-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Use the media option to set the page size and
	margins.  Selecting different paper size should work now.

2006-10-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add some 16 pin 3x3 mm QFN packages

2006-10-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/buffer.c: If we're converting a buffer to an element and the
	buffer has no associated PCB; assign the current one so we have *a*
	group table to use.

2006-10-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Keep

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: remove some unused variables

2006-10-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: - include resource.h before lesstif.h to make sure we get a

2006-10-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: remove some unused variables and add a
	missing return value

2006-10-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2006-10-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resource.h: be consistent with underscores in

	* doc/actions.texi, src/action.c, src/hid.h,
	src/hid/common/hidinit.c, src/main.c: Load settings from

2006-10-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Remove debugging printf.

2006-10-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Fix plugin init function logic.

2006-10-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2006-10-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: extract the version from configure.ac instead of
	hard coding it.

2006-10-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Fix off-by-one error.

2006-10-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: Check for popen().  So far
	nothing is done as a result of this.

2006-10-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: It should be "-mms-bitfields" instead of
	"--mms-bitfields".  Noted by Cesar Strauss.

2006-09-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* configure, configure.ac: Add -rdynamic when it's available.

2006-09-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/todo: I did the one about separate ps files.

2006-09-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, win32/build_pcb: Move the gcc flags that
	cause builds under cygwin to produce non-cygwin binaries out of the
	configure script and into the script which is used to build a
	non-cygwin binary under cygwin.  The end result should be the same for users who use
	./win32/build_pcb but users who wish to compile a cygwin binary
	should be able to now.  Adapated from patch #1567401 "Re-enabling the Cygwin port" by Cesar
	Strauss.

2006-09-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/extract-docs: make this script more robust with respect to the
	formatting of the help and syntax strings.  In particular, variable
	whitespace is now allowed in the "static const char" declaration and
	the string may not begin on the same line as the declaration.  This
	allows the source code to run through indent(1) and still have the
	docs extracted properly.

2006-09-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: We don't directly need X stuff anymore
	unless we're using the lesstif HID so don't look for X except in
	that case.  This avoids some issues seen on some systems which have
	older libraries in /usr/X11R6/lib (like freetype or fontconfig).

2006-09-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: use the unified "about" string.

2006-09-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/mymem.c, src/mymem.h: const-ify DSAddString

2006-09-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c, src/misc.c, src/misc.h: Improve the gtk
	"about" dialog box output to explicitly list the HID's which have
	been compiled in.  As part of this, pull out the code which
	generates the text of the dialog box into its own function so that
	it can be used by other HID's.

2006-09-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: A layer group that only contains a layer named
	"outline" or "route" will not have pins, pads, or vias drawn.

2006-09-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/flags.c: A layer group containing only an "outline"
	or "route" layer will be named "outline" when exported.

2006-09-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Add a --verbose option to list gerber
	files as they're printed.

2006-09-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rats.c: When optimizing rats, if there are > 0 of them,
	display a message indicating how many.  This way when the layout is
	not complete you see how far you have to go and also you see that
	the operation has done something.

2006-09-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: If Settings.RatThickness is less than 20, it's a pixel
	size, not a pcb size.

2006-09-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Display remaining rats in status bar.

2006-09-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,

	pixels.

2006-09-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/fontmode.c: add missing return value

2006-09-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c, src/file.c: remove some unused variables

2006-09-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/buffer.c: Fix bug in poly point sorting for element
	conversion.

2006-09-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Fix undo for MinMaskGap()

2006-09-21   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2006-09-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add multi-file output option.

2006-09-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/flags.c, src/hid/gerber/gerber.c, src/hid/hidint.h: 
	Break out layer->filename code.  Fix bug in top/bottom detection.

2006-09-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: If the output file(s) can't be opened for
	writing then spit out an error message instead of segfaulting.  The
	segfaults were noted in bug [ 1556894 ] "segfault when exporting to
	non-existing directory" reported by Stephan Boettcher.

2006-09-13   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	refdes matches the name of a macro and m4 expands it.  Patch
	provided by Peter Clifton.

2006-09-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/to.inc: remove a ' in an output comment line which threw off a

	* src/hid/common/actions.c:  * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk * Patch to

2006-09-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in,
	lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: Go ahead and let configure process the
	m4lib_to_newlib script.  Also remove a couple of hardcoded paths in
	the same script.

2006-09-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/to.inc: Fix up the pads and drill sizes on the TO* packages.
	Based on patch [ 1108881 ] "Fix to m4 library hole sizes" by Walter
	Fetter Lages.  I added comments containing the actual dimensions
	from the JEDEC drawings and comments about how the pad size and
	drill size were selected.  Based on the JEDEC drawings I adjusted
	some of the drill and pad sizes.  I did not change or examine pin
	locations, numbering, or silk.

2006-09-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: improve the drill sizes for several footprints.
	Changes provided by patch [ 1108881 ] "Fix to m4 library hole sizes"
	by Walter Fetter Lages.

2006-09-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: ensure that derive_default_filename()
	always comes back with a valid string even when we don't have a name
	for the pcbfile.  This fixes bug [ 1548756 ] "Segfault when
	exporting png files" reported by Werner Hoch.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/connector.inc: increase PKG_CONNECTOR and PKG_CONNECTOR_DIL
	hole size to something more reasonable.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: - remove the BRE* footprints.  The required PKG_RECTANGULAR macro
	  doesn't exist anywhere and I can't figure out what the correct
	  behaviour should be anyway so rather than propagate a very
	  questionable footprint name, kill it right here.  - Fix the problem where the ACY*P and RCY*P packages called
	  non-existant macros.  They now produce the same footprints as the
	  ACY* and RCY* packages but with a polarity marking.  The suitability
	  for any particular part number should be still verified before using
	them on a board.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: expand the PKG_AXIAL_LAY and PKG_RADIAL_CAN macros
	to take an extra optional argument.  When set to 1, this optional
	argument causes the part to have a "+" by pin 1 and "-" by pin 2.
	This was done instead of implementing the missing
	PKG_AXIAL_LAY_POLAR and  PKG_RADIAL_CAN_POLAR macros.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: Rather than putting a huge list of
	footprints into one index file, break it out by library.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: remove unused PKG_DUMMY which did not do anything
	anyway

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: - put both the index.html file and the broken.html file in the
	output directory.  - run pcb-bin from the src build directory to avoid complaints about
	  not being able to find the font - use .fp as the file extension for footprints - fix up the .png output file names - fix up the links in the index file

2006-09-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/global.h, src/undo.c, src/undo.h: add a
	Renumber() action which renumbers reference designators and outputs
	a "was/is" sort of file which can be used for back annotation if
	someone writes a utility to apply those changes to a schematic.  For now Renumber() is still considered somewhat experimental and
	hence is not hooked up to the menus yet.

2006-08-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	can be found.

2006-08-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: Apply patch from patch [ 1496742 ] Make 'a' key
	(SetSame) work again submitted by Wim Lewis.

2006-08-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: when pkg-config fails to find the desired
	version of gtk or glib, then print the pkg-config output as part of
	the error message.  Suggested in bug # 1507555 by Mark Whitis.

2006-08-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: use 0.01 mm instead of 0.05 mm for the roundoff for

	between pads just over 6 mils instead of just under 6 mils.

2006-08-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lpr/lpr.c: Fix bug [ 1534098 ] Segmentation fault in GTK

2006-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/copy.c: Remove extra calls to Draw().  This greatly speeds up
	copy operations.  This is especially true when pasting large blocks
	of layout.  Patch supplied by  Tibor Palinkas as patch #1532922.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/fontmode.c: Add font editing
	mode (FontEdit() and FontSave())

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/file.c: Use the old style (mil) syntax when saving font info,
	if the values permit it, for readability and to save file space.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Allow New() to take a name, so that the user need
	not be prompted during scripts and such.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/move.c: When deleting a layer, make sure to zero out the
	now-unused slot at the end.

2006-08-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: After running PATH_XTRA and checking for
	various X libs (Xpm, etc), we need to use $X_LIBS as part of LIBS in
	subsequent library tests or we'll have a failure.  This should
	address some issues noted recently on one of the gEDA lists and
	configuring with lesstif and the png HID's.

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/print.c, src/print.h: When the drill list
	fits "naturally", no offset is added, which makes me happy.  When

2006-07-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	src/hid/ps/ps.c: Apply a patch from Larry Doolittle.  Refactors filename handling code common to the file export HIDs
	(bom, gerber, png, eps, ps).  The png code had one feature (last_made_filename) that was missing
	in the others.  This refactoring brings all the HIDs to feature
	parity, which lets pcb -x bom --bomfile=foo.txt bar.pcb work as expected.  The old code ignores the command line flag, and
	writes the bom to bar.bom.  Likewise for .xy, .gbr, .eps, and .ps
	files.  Also fixes a couple of spelling errors.

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c: change from NONE_PRESSED to
	NO_BUTTON_PRESSED since the former is not part of the ButtonState
	enum while the latter is.

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: comment out with #if 0 the code related to
	lesstif_options and lesstif_resources since those were both empty.
	With this change pcb should build correctly on 64-bit Irix-6.5 with
	version 7.41 of the MIPSpro compilers.  There are still a handful of
	compiler warnings to investigate.

2006-04-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/actions.texi, src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c,

	src/hid/lesstif/main.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/netlist.c, src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: Document
	lesstif hid actions.

2006-04-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/box.h, src/find.c: rely on the autoconf test for inline
	instead of using our own based on __GNUC__.  This will let other
	non-gcc C99 compilers take advantage of inline.

2006-04-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, doc/actions.texi,

	src/hid/lesstif/styles.c, src/hid/lesstif/xincludes.h, src/misc.c,
	src/parse_y.y, src/strflags.c, src/strflags.h: - add checks for sys/param.h and compiler understanding of 'inline'.  - remove a handful of warnings which showed up with the sunpro
	compiler.  - move the X11 includes into a header where they can be included in
	  a way which keeps them from messing up the namespace of the rest of   pcb.  Fixes some obscure warnings from sunpro.

2006-04-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: get this to properly link when --disable-gif is
	used and the installed libgd does not have gif support.

2006-04-19   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add --psfade option.

2006-04-18   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	doc/pcbfile.texi, doc/version.texi, src/const.h, src/hid.h,
	src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c, src/parse_y.y: 
	Remove all the prev-next-up links, reformat all the texi files to
	allow for automatic structure generation.  Add helper hooks in the
	extractor to let the source files control what types of nodes and
	document structure is used for each category.  Auto-create nodes and
	document substructure for each key within each category.

2006-04-17   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: For the Gtk HID, add an
	alternate vertical window layout mode to help on lower vertical
	resolution displays.

2006-04-17   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/netlist.c: Include sys/types.h so that regex compiles on more
	hosts.

	src/hid/gtk/gui-log-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Fix soldermask draw
	while TAB view from solder side.  Don't raise windows if already shown so library & netlist window
	won't grab focus.  Focus can still be grabbed if an already shown
	window is reshown via the top menu bar.  Not sure yet how to handle
	this case.

2006-04-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: switch the output scaling to default to 100 dpi
	instead of fixing the max dimension at 800 pixels.  This at makes
	the default be a sort of to scale (for 100 dpi monitors it will be
	to scale) image.

2006-04-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Support --bg-image in the Gtk HID.  Images can be
	jpg, png, gif, etc. as supported by the Gdk installation.  Zooming gets slow at higher zoom levels, but I can address that
	later when I have more time.

2006-04-14   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/global.h: Make sure the Message and return are in the same
	scope.

2006-04-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2006-04-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/eps.c: Determine when we need to use the complex erase
	logic, and when we can just paint white.  Painting white is a LOT
	faster, and avoids rasterization in ps2pdf.

2006-04-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/database.txt, doc/ideas/database.txt, doc/ideas/keepouts.txt,
	doc/keepouts.txt: move these to an ideas subdirectory to hopefully
	more clearly indicate that not only are these not implemented yet
	but that they are not even certain to ever be implemented.

2006-04-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi, src/netlist.c: Document

	* doc/actions.texi, src/action.c, src/global.h: Add a "ToLayout"
	option for the PasteBuffer() action.  You can now do things like
	PasteBuffer(ToLayout, 10000, 200000) to paste from the current
	buffer Also add a DumpLibrary() action.

2006-04-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	lib/generic.m4, lib/resistor_0.25W.list, lib/resistor_array.list,
	lib/texas_inst_voltage_reg.m4, lib/transistor.m4: - add a missing description and move some footprints from the wrong
	.list file to the correct .list file to be able to pick up the
	descriptions and parameters from the corresponding .m4 file.  - all of the m4 libs should at least be correct in the sense that
	the pieces are all there and they all run through m4 correctly.
	They have not been verified any more for correctness, but this is
	progress.

2006-04-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/print.c, src/report.c: Print correct symbol counts for drills

	elemnts to file does nothing.

2006-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: When
	building docs, look for a perl to use.  This will let the user set
	PERL in their environment and have configure pick it up.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: - make the ESC key return you to the arrow tool if you are in via,
	  thermal, lock, etc modes.  - in line, poly, arc, etc. modes, the first ESC press returns you to
	  "tool neutral" and the 2nd ESC press returns you to the arrow tool.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c, src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: add pointer

	* src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in,
	src/script/pcb-print: remove the pcb-print script.  It is obsolete
	now that the HID version directly supports command line export/print
	through the export HID's.

2006-04-05   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/find.c: Expand search box during bloat in case the box overlap
	would otherwise prevent checking.  This repairs a really bad bug
	introduced when the rtrees were used to speed the find tracing.

	* src/misc.c: fixed pin/via bounding box to include thermal tails;
	bug reported by CL

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Be a bit more careful with rouding issues when
	converting to pcb units.  Hopefully this will help with the issue
	reported on the geda lists about 23.99 mil vias when the user
	thought they picked 24 mil ones.  Patch posted on geda-user by DJ.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, src/hid/png/png.c: check to
	see which graphic file formats are supported by the installed GD.
	If the desired list is not found, abort and tell the user they can
	explicitly disable certain file types.  Should deal with installed
	versions of gd which do not support GIF output.

	* src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: fix a prototype

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dolists.h, src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/menu.c, src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: move variable
	declarations to the beginning of blocks to make gcc-2.95 and
	probably other non-gcc compilers happy.

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: Check to make sure a pointer is not NULL before
	dereferencing it.  This seems to be the place where the segfault was
	happening sometimes when saving connection data.  For now, spit out
	a warning message because I think there may be some other underlying
	bug which causes the NULL pointer in the first place.

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/mymem.h: do not redefine malloc if we are using dmalloc

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: access djopt_set_auto_only() via the
	associated action instead of directly

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/djopt.c, src/djopt.h: fix prototype for an action.  kills one
	more compiler warning

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: add a missing typecase

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/pcb-menu.res: - When changing selected line size from the menu, do it to the
	selected arcs to.  - Add a SelectedArcs option to the ChangeSize action.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/select.c: Fix a bug where actions using SelectedPads did
	nothing and SelectedPins picked up both pins and pads.  Noted by bug
	#1438523

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/strflags.c: avoid allocating 0 bytes

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: fix a typo in a comment

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: No need to use strdup(Concat()) as Concat already
	gives us allocated memory that is not referenced anywhere else.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: Fix an off by one overflow of a malloc'ed buffer.
	Found with ElectricFence.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: in a function which is supposed to return a string but
	is commented out with #ifdef FIXME, return a big warning string
	rather than no return value until I/we figure out how to fix it.
	Hopefully if this triggers bugs it will be easier to locate.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: add back in the --enable-efence and
	--enable-dmalloc configure flags to turn on ElectricFence and
	dmalloc debugging respectively.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c: Make sure
	we initialize some variables before using them.  Fixes a segfault on
	startup problem noted on NetBSD/alpha when displaying to an 8-bit
	Xvnc.

2006-03-27   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: I wrapped too much into the verbose
	option so the file load stopped working - fixed.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: bump the rev letter to help identify this
	as the HID version if someone pulls up the "about" dialog box.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: - Remove a debug printf which tried to print a NULL string.  Avoids
	a segfault bug.  - When chosing "Save Layout" on a new layout (that hadn't already
	been given a name or filename), correctly use the new file name that
	is selected with the dialog box.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: - remove a debug printf which was trying to print a NULL string.
	  Fixes a segfault bug on solaris-2.9/sparc.  - Fix the behaviour when doing "Save Layout" on a new board that   didn't have a file name yet.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: add a --listen option for the lesstif HID
	too (works the same as the gtk one -- listens on stdin for actions).

2006-03-26   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: 
	Pan to a netlist window selected node if it's not visible.  Fix a pan bug.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: add cast to avoid compiler
	warnings

2006-03-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/pcb-menu.res: Add

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Turn
	of Disable all nets button when NetlistChanged.  Make some diagnostic output only if verbose.

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Set netlist nodes enabled by
	default when NetlistChanged.

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix draw arc when flipped.

	will help with those who don't read the README.cvs file...

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: use fileno(stdin) instead of 1 to
	get the stdin file descriptor.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/drill.c: fix a segfault when printing a board with no drill
	holes at all.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: add a --listen option which causes
	pcb to listen on the standard input for actions.  This should open
	the door to experimenting with having gschem interact directly with
	pcb.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Fix a bug in options parsing where the
	loop looking for matches continued after a match had already been
	found.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: add a help string for --lib-newlib

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: minor cleanup of status output

2006-03-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Also look for ~/.pcb/pcb-menu.res.
	Actually use the path we found ;-)

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: List the available HID's in the

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.am, README.cvs, configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: - when not in maintainer mode, do not list all the dependencies for
	  the manual.  This allows regular users who are building from a
	  tarball to avoid having to rebuild the manual and lets them simply
	  take the preformatted one.  This avoids recently noted issues with
	  incompatibility with older versions of texinfo which seem somewhat
	  common.  It also removes the requirement for having latex installed
	  and for building the png HID for pcb.  - add a --disable-doc flag which allows users who are building from
	  CVS to skip the doc directory and thus avoid the need for the
	  documentation formatting tools.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots: note the DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS variable

2006-03-24   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix gtk magenta color messages ->
	initialize all new hidGC colornames to Settings.BackgroundColor
	because bgGC color outside of ghid_expose_callback() is never
	initialized and it's used to draw outside of the callback when an
	object is selected.

	instead of the source directory (in case they are not the same)

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: Rework the dependencies on the
	various generated files a bit to hopefully correctly include all
	dependencies.  Also allow this to continue and just use the shipped
	preformatted docs in the case where latex and friends are not
	available.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in: correctly find the font file correctly find the
	m4lib stuff when building outside the source tree.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, lib/ListLibraryContents.sh,
	lib/ListLibraryContents.sh.in: move ListLibraryContents.sh to being
	something created at configure time like the rest of the m4lib
	stuff.  This puts it in the build directory and allows you to run
	pcb out of the build directory prior to installation even in the
	case of a read only source tree.  While here add some
	AM_CONDITIONALS to indicate when latex and friends are not available
	for formating the reference card.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: add missing lesstif header to

	couple of spots, etc.

2006-03-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2006-03-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/QueryLibrary.sh.in, lib/common.m4: add an optional -fp
	argument which will display the correct footprint= attribute for
	gschem.  Generally useful for debugging.

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/pci.inc, lib/pci.list, lib/pci.m4: Remove the abuse of the
	value field as a way of passing in multiple extra parameters.  While
	here fix the pinlists.  These footprints still have diagonal pads
	which are not allowed.

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.in, src/Makefile.in: regen

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/genericsmt.inc, lib/genericsmt.list,
	lib/genericsmt.m4: garbage collect some footprints that were not at
	all conforming to the correct usage of the m4 library system.  In
	addition, they were rather redundant.

2006-03-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/CreateLibraryContents.sh.in: put the correct gschem footprint=
	attribute in [] at the end of each description

	* doc/extract-docs: New file, for extracting inline documentation.

2006-03-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/QueryLibrary.sh.in: eat blank lines of which there can be many
	in the element output

2006-03-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in, doc/pcb.css, doc/pcb.texi,
	src/const.h, src/parse_y.y: Inline documentation.

2006-03-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/change.c, src/change.h: Add "join" to SetFlag,
	ClrFlag, and ChangeFlag actions.

2006-03-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Fixed bug where pads were assumed to be on the
	same side as the element

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-03-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/crosshair.c: Crosshair snap to pad ends instead of center -
	necessary for rat drawing because rats only connect at pad end
	points.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-03-06   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/print.c: Fab author fixes from Karel.

2006-03-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/parse_y.y: Fix reduce-reduce conflicts (patch from DJ).

2006-03-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: - clarify that the manual does not currently document the very
	  latest pcb output file format.  - add a (sparsely populated) glossary appendix - add a note about how to change layers

2006-03-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h, src/action.c, src/create.c, src/file.c,
	src/find.c, src/global.h, src/gui-config.c, src/parse_y.y,
	src/rotate.c, src/sizedialog.c, src/vendor.c: add DRC checks for
	minimum drill diameter and minimum annular ring.

2006-03-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rats.c: When manually adding nets, make sure we actually pick
	a unique name when a new net is created.  Fixes a bug noted by
	Vanessa Dannenberg.

2006-02-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pad.pcb: Add a pad drawing showing how a pad is drawn with a
	rectangular aperture.  Not used yet, but this will replace the tgif
	drawing at some point.

2006-01-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/error.c: apply some fixes for DragonFly BSD

2006-01-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: format cleanup of ActionChangePinName() to bring
	more in line with GNU coding standards for C code formatting.

2006-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: document ChangePinName action

2006-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/command.c: add a ChangePinName()
	action which lets you change the name of a pin/pad on an element.
	For example, ChangePinName(U1, 7, VCC) changes the name of pin #7 on
	U1 to "VCC".  This makes it simple to propagate pin names from a
	schematic capture tool to the layout without requiring the layout
	library to know the pin names for every component.

	handling

2006-01-15   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: Fixed bugs in GetClosestPolygonPoint where (a) the
	passed point was not used, and (b) projection of the segment past
	the end was being used when it shouldn't.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Speed computation of route costs, it uses about
	13% of the CPU time during routing.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: Speed up the rtree searches by establishing better
	balance of the cluster size during a node split. This reduces the
	tree depth resulting in faster searching.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/strflags.c: Fixed clearline flag so that arcs also have this
	property

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/change.c: Fixed bug where clearances could be set 1 below the
	spacing setting

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.in: regen [put the html manual in 1 file]

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am: put the html manual in 1 file.  Its a bit easier
	to manage

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/version.texi: bump date last touched

2005-12-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: cause the missing ) in PKG_SMT_2PAD_MM100 to appear

2005-12-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: - added the pad drawing showing how a pad is drawn with an aperture.  - added some comments about the evolving file format for layout
	files.

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c, src/global.h, src/gui-netlist-window.c, src/rats.c: 
	fix a bug which prevented disabling nets from the ratsnest

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: fix duplicate PKG_SME4 which should have been called
	 SME5.  Reported by Wojciech Kazubski in bug #1353304

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in: Be sure to set the library path to the source
	tree.  Patch supplied by Wim Lewis in patch #1362564

2005-10-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: redo the 0201, 0402, etc passives to bring them in
	line with the IPC recommendations.  The pads on, for example 0603,
	were too small before.  They worked, were really not adequate.

2005-10-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: add a PKG_SMT_2PAD_MM100 which directly takes
	dimensions for the pads, silk, and placement courtyard from IPC-7351
	for things like 0402 capacitor and resistor footprints.

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* autogen.sh: make this script a bit more verbose and also abort on

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: make sure to check for -lX11 even when we're using
	the gtk gui.  action.c still has a direct call to an X function
	(XWarpPointer) so on some systems (Solaris) you need to explicitly
	link -lX11 instead of getting it through the gtk dependencies

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: check for gtk+ >= 2.4.0 instead of 2.2.0 since we
	need >= 2.4.0

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in: add pcb-print to
	the list of distributed files

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/pcb-print: fix a bug in the --add-alignment option.
	Noted by David Baird

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gui-library-window.c: fix -auto-place for the library window

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/pcb-print: add script to make it easier to print from
	the command line

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/command.c, src/global.h,
	src/gui-library-window.c, src/gui-log-window.c,
	src/gui-netlist-window.c, src/gui-pinout-window.c,
	src/gui-top-window.c, src/main.c, src/misc.c,
	src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in: - change the Print action to PrintDialog since it causes the print   dialog box to come up - add a new Print action provided by David Baird as patch # 1212168.    Modified by me to work with the gtk version of pcb.  - to let this action work, allow actions to take a parameter list
	  and # of parameters to allow large numbers of arguments.  - modify the Quit action and some of the initialization code so that   you can use Quit() in a startup script.  - add a -auto-place command line option which causes the windows to
	  be automatically placed rather than letting the window manager do
	  it.  This is useful when printing via the command line.  - add a command line shell script for printing.  This is a wrapper
	  which takes a whole bunch of flags relating to the print parameters
	  and translates that to the correct invocation of the Print() action.    Shell script provided by David Baird as part of patch #1212168 and   modified by me to make it portable.

2005-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add 1008 package

2005-07-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/bourns.inc: fix the pin order.

2005-07-24   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/gui-config.c: Fix initial layer groups so that layer named
	'component' is actually on the component side and layer named
	'solder' is actually on the solder side. Unfortunately the GTK
	version saves the old bug in the .pcb/preferences file so no
	patching will fix existing installations. They must manually edit
	the layer groups and check the "use as default" to fix their
	installation.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-07-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* aclocal.m4, configure: regen (fix botched commit which was missing
	some M4 paths)

2005-07-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi, doc/version.texi: add appendix describing the
	centroid file format along with the algorithm for finding the
	centroid and rotation.

2005-07-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/print.c: remove some redundant code to make things more clear

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/genericsmt.m4: fix typo

	* aclocal.m4, configure: regen

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/vendor.c: add a check for sys/types.h and then
	if found, include in vendor.c.  Needed to build on FreeBSD.  Problem
	and fix reported in bug #1220963.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/qfn.inc: hires-ify the QFN packages.  While here make sure we
	use an appropriate soldermask relief for this style of package.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gui-dialog-print.c, src/gui-dialog-size.c, src/set.c: remove
	the inclusion of menu.h.  We don't use that file anymore and the
	only reason we could still build on some systems is we'd find the
	/usr/include/menu.h from curses!  Problem noted in bug #1226924 by
	Axeloide.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/refcard.tex, src/gui-keyref-window.c, src/gui-output-events.c: 
	apply patches provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1230708.   Fix key bindings for drill size changes to be <mod>s  and <shift><mod>s to agree with the Xaw default key  bindings.   Add missing key bindings '/' and '.' for cycle  multiline mode and toggle 45 degree enforcement  respectively.   Fix refcard.tex to reflect the current set of key binding.   Now the gtk key bindings and the refcard should be in  sync and be the same as the default Xaw PCB bindings  with one exception: the buffer selection binding is  <control>1...5 instead of <shift>1...5. This can be  fixed but at the cost of removing the shortcuts from  the menus because gtk can't use <shift>digits as menu  shortcuts.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* INSTALL, NEWS, README-GTK_PORT: apply patches provided by Bill
	Wilson in patch #1230704  This patch adds a note to the README-GTK_PORT about  runtime warnings if using early gtk+2.4.0 versions.   It also makes small adjustments to the INSTALL file to  remove an outdated Xt reference and a non-existent  68HC11 file reference.   In addition, note that gtk+2.4 is needed, not gtk+2.2.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/global.h, src/gui-config.c, src/gui-top-window.c, src/gui.h: 
	apply patches provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1227292  As per a request on the gEDA list, this patch adds a  Preferences option to make the layout name appear on  the window title bar instead of on the main menu bar  area. This is convenient when the layout name might be  somewhat long and takes up too much horizontal space on  the menu bar area.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/gui-config.c, src/gui-top-window.c: apply patches
	 provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1227205 When loading layouts using
	 alternating mil/mm units, the PCB units displaying can get out of
	 sync. This patch fixes it.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c, src/gui-utils.c: apply patches provided by Bill Wilson
	in patch #1215935 1) The DRC user interface issue has been reported on the gEDA
	mailing list and is listed on the PCB bugs page as request id
	1206762 dated 2005-05-23 01:29 and is fixed in this patch.  3) Fix a dangling DRC check g_message() which I overlooked fixing
	during the final Gtk port cleanup.  4) Adjust the DRC draw centering to be 1/4 screen offset since the
	continue dialog is centered (under window manager control) and that
	was covering up the DRC highlighted portion of the draw which was
	previously also centered.  2) The log window was not scrolling to keep most recent log items
	added in view and this patch fixes that.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/const.h, src/global.h, src/gui-netlist-window.c: apply the
	patches provided by Wim Lewis in patch #1189989 to allow pcb to
	compile more cleanly on OpenBSD.

	mounting hole

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Pcb.ad.in, src/main.c, src/set.c: - break the status line into 2 lines as it was getting rather long - put the cursor position line below the menu as it is also getting   rather long with the metric display.  Besides keeping the 2 lines from being cutoff on smaller displays,
	it seems to avoid some of the strange Xaw issues seen in bug
	#1099862 and patch #1042731 where the porthole for the main drawing
	area is not properly sized and where the status line is sometimes
	covered by the porthole.

	* src/Makefile.in: regen

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	source directory.

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi, src/action.c, src/pcb-menu.res: Add "Selected" and

	disperse all of them.  Add corresponding menu choices.

2005-01-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/print.c: avoid having text overlaying text in the fab drawing

2005-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: use LAYOUT_BOTTOM to always put the status line at the
	bottom of the main window.  Gets rid of some annoying bugs on
	solaris and some other systems where the status line would sometimes
	get covered up when the window was resized.

2005-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c: in the message log produced when a via size has to
	be increased to meet the minimum copper, add a location to make it

2004-08-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resmenu.c: Fix a minor memory leak bug which allocated space
	for 10 more pointers everytime invoke_action() was called.  While here add a few comments about whats going on in this function.

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	PCB

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: use "Reference Designator" instead of "Name on
	PCB" as the former is more standard

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: exclude Makefile, Makefile.am, and Makefile.in as
	valid element names as these may reside in a lib directory

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	find more info

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: add one more Usage message.  this time for the
	RemoveSelected() action

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c, src/misc.c: allow --version, --help, and --copyright
	to also work since those are typically supported by GNU programs.

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: In the Usage() function be sure to restore stderr at
	the beginning since this function calls exit().  This will ensure
	that the Usage() message can actually be seen in all cases.  Fixes
	  the following:  clock AT oberon:~$ pcb --version    clock AT oberon:~$ noted by Karel Kulhav on the gEDA mailing
	list.

2004-08-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2004-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: avoid 'inline' unless we're using gcc.

2004-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/res_parse.y: use foo?foo:bar instead of foo?:bar as the latter
	is a gcc extension.  Makes the irix c compiler happy.

2004-07-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: update the 150 and 300 mil width SOIC packages per
	the IPC recommendations at footprint.ipc.org.  Partially addresses
	the "silk on pad" bug noted in bug report #995401.

2004-07-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: improve the decision on adding or not adding a silk
	arc on the COMMON_SMT_DIL_MIL macro

2004-07-17   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/print.c: Only clear silk on same side as pad. Patch
	contributed by burto

	* doc/pcb.texi, src/draw.c, src/draw.h, src/global.h, src/main.c,
	src/misc.c: Add limited support for a behind-the-board background
	image.

2004-07-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rubberband.c: Fix a bug related to checking for the
	intersection of a circular region defined by an line end point and
	its radius and a rectangular pin/pad.  The old code looked for the
	intersection of the smallest square which encloses the circular
	region and the rectangular pin/pad region.  However this method
	claims that there are intersections when in fact there are not.  For
	example a very wide trace has a significant area enclosed by the
	square which encloses the circular region defined by the line end
	and radius that is not enclosed by the circular region.  The new code actually looks for intersection of the circular region
	and the square region.

2004-07-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rubberband.c: fix some errors where the diameter was used
	where the radius should have been used when looking for circular
	regions which intersect.  Fixes bug report #978412.  Partial patch
	provided in the bug report, additional bugs fixed by me.  Note: a bug still exists when calculating line -> rectangular pad
	intersection.  A fix will be coming.

2004-07-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	XAPPLRESDIR and unset XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

2004-06-30   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resmenu.c: make 'str' static so that the memory allocated by
	MyStrdup() can properly be freed on the next call of invoke_action.

2004-06-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2004-06-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add a few more 400mil width DIP packages (DIPxM)

2004-06-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dev_rs274x.c: make sure we define all aperture codes used by
	arcs.  Fixes the bug reported in bug #969903 by Werner Hoch where an
	arc of a width not used by anything else in the layout does not have
	its aperture defined.

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: fix the function name strings passed to MyCalloc().

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: Do not arbitrarily change the zoom setting
	whenever running DRC.  Especially if there are no DRC errors, we
	don't want/need to change the zoom.  Noted by Mark Becker.

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: Add 0.5 and 0.1 mil grid selections.  Requested

	current input layer are not changed by DRC.  Noted by Mark Becker.

2004-06-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen after rpath flag order change

2004-06-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: change the order in the list of rpath flags which
	are tried out.  This is because when -R was tried first, it was
	accepted on linux systems because even though gcc didn't like it, it
	still exited with 0.  The new order seems to do the right thing on
	solaris, linux, and netbsd as the compiler now actually gives an
	error code for the flags it does not like.

2004-06-05   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/djopt.c: Be even more picky about which line is chosen as an
	example.

	is a start.

2004-06-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/default_font:  add @ character.  Absence noted by Dave
	McGuire.

2004-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: add a GetXY() to the 'copy selection to buffer'

	* src/change.c: add missing prototype

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h: set MASKFRAME to be 3 (mils) instead of 0.  This
	way the soldermask opening will be larger than the pads for
	components defined using the older style format which did not
	explicitly give soldermask relief size.

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: document the SetFlag(), ClrFlag(), and ChangeFlag()
	actions

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: correct location for Pcb appdefaults file

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in, src/script/pcb.in: For the pcb wrapper script,
	if the first argument is "-gdb", pick off that flag and run pcb
	inside of the gdb debugger.  Should simplify debugging a bit.

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/change.c, src/change.h,
	src/main.c: Add SetFlag, ClrFlag, and ChangeFlag actions.  These
	currently let you set, clear, or change the square, octagon, or
	thermal pads.  For example :SetFlag(SelectedVias,thermal)
	:ClrFlag(SelectedObjects,square) :ChangeFlag(SelectedPads,octagon,1)

2004-05-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/djopt.c: Fix the segfault bug noted in bug report #959073 by
	Bob Paddock.  While here, also fix a bug which can potentially cause
	a floating point exception.

2004-05-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2004-05-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: update the COMMON_SMT_2PAD_MIL macro to the newer
	element format.  With this change, the soldermask relief and
	clearance can now be specified for the pads.  This fixes the issue
	noted recently on the geda mailing list about 0805 footprints from
	the ~geda library having soldermask openings which are the same size
	as the pads.

2004-05-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resmenu.c: RCS Id and config.h police

2004-04-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/print.c: When printing to RS-274-X also generate a centroid
	data file (X-Y data) with the required data to drive a pick and
	place machine.  The centroid of each part is calculated from the
	center of each pin/pad.  The rotation is determined by looking at
	the angle of pin1 relative to the centroid.  In addition, generate a bill of materials file.  This lists the
	part, quantity, and list of reference designators.

2004-04-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/res_lex.l, src/res_parse.y, src/resmenu.c: fix some 64-bit

	Also fix one of the pad widths on a footprint which was obviously
	broken.

2004-04-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: hires-ify the COMMON_SMT_DIL_MIL macro.  The macro
	already took input arguments in 1/1000 mil so now we simple only
	reduce the resolution to 1/100 mil in the output instead of to 1
	mil.  This also helps the COMMON_SMT_DIL_MM which calls the
	COMMON_SMT_DIL_MIL macro.

	  update") * Detect tgif, if not found pad.{png,eps} just isn't built (what's   that for, anyway?)  Prebuilt copies of those should be checked in   too at some point.

	* lib/to.inc: rename the SOT23 and SOT323 footprints here to
	SOT23_CEL and SOT323_CEL to avoid a conflict with the ones defined

	order to provide negative image ground planes for gerber output when
	possible. Some fab vendors can't handle or charge extra for
	composite ground planes which is the motivation for this.  Negative
	image planes are made when (1) There are no lines, arcs, text, or
	pads on a layer and (2) There is exactly 1 polygon on the layer and (3) All vias/holes/pins pierce the polygon. The polygon is then
	assumed to consume all of the area and only the thermal reliefs and
	pin/via clearances are needed. haceaton 11/19/03

	layer is handled.  The polarity is not changed but it now correctly
	works for postscript output as well as gerber output.  Previously
	the postscript output produced white on a white background or black
	on a black background.  This addresses PR 825680 filed by Russ Dill.

	* src/dev_rs274x.c: fix two bugs related to gerber file generation.
	The first bug is triggered when the first aperture used in a file is
	the same as the last aperture used in the previous file.  In this
	case the aperture selection code is missing from the output file.  The second bug is when the first point drawn has its Y coordinate
	(in PCB coordinates) equal to zero.  The output will be at gerber Y
	coordinate zero which is on the opposite side of the board.  Thanks to Gabriel Paubert (paubert at iram dot es) for noting these
	bugs and supplying a patch.

	example/libraries/example.m4: Add two new chapters to the manual.
	The first attempts to provide some more documentation about library
	creation.  It includes a complete example of adding footprints using
	M4 style libraries as well as giving instructions on creating newlib
	style footprints.  The second added chapter shows how to take a
	design from start to finish using gEDA as the schematic capture and
	PCB as the layout tool.  This chapter still needs work, but early
	feedback is good and its better than no documentation.

	newlib style directory tree's to be specified in the Xresource.
	This provides an easy way to have per-user and per-project library
	directories.  These directories may either be specified as an
	absolute or relative path.  Patches provided by Tony (droghedra at users dot sourceforge dot
