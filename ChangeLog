	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, win32/build_pcb, win32/pcb.nsi.in: 
	[win32] Repair tool icons on windows version.  - install gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.exe to update loaders.cache at   win32 install time.  This is needed to correct the paths to the   libs for the loaders.  - in the installer, run gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders to rebuild the   cache.  This happens when the installer is running.  - fix the win32 specific code that looks for the loaders.cache file.

	* src/hid/bom/bom.c, src/hid/ipcd356/ipcd356.c,
	src/hid/nelma/nelma.c: Update some export HID output file modes - Some HIDs were using "w" and some "wb" for opening text output

	* win32/build_pcb, win32/pcb.nsi.in: Cleanup the win32 build script
	a good bit.  An important change is that instead of blindly
	installing all of the mingw cross system root files, only install a
	set of listed ones.  This not only reduces the size of the windows

	* Makefile.am, README.win32, configure.ac, win32/Makefile.am: Add a
	few missing files related to a cygwin build.  With this I'm able to
	build a windows installer from git sources or from a tarball under
	cygwin.  The installer then does not depend on cygwin at runtime.
	Added notes to the README.win32 pointing users who wish to build
	with minpack to README.w32

2017-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	packages for everything we need TODO:  prune what we install from
	       the cygwin packages to not install more than what we need TODO:

	* win32/.gitignore, win32/build_pcb, win32/config.mk,
	win32/pcb-win32-deps.mk, win32/pcb.nsi.in, win32/setup/libgd.mk: 
	Make lots of progress towards getting this to work again.  Turns out
	cygwin has packages for mingw targets and so it is possible to avoid
	most of the building of external libs.  This framework is working
	but has a few things to address before making it prime-time.

2017-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: replace
	g_win32_get_package_installation_directory() with
	g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module() as the former
	has been deprecated since glib-2.18 which was 8 years ago.

2017-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: When searching for newlib libraries, we can't just
	check if the first character of the search path is '/' and expect it
	to work on win32 systems.  Add some expanded logic to try and handle
	this case.  Now we get libraries displayed again.

2017-01-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-library-window.c: Fix the display of library
	elements on win32 which was broken by d80224b3.  Replaces '/' with
	PCB_DIR_SEPARATOR_C.

2017-01-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/getline.c, src/strcasestr.c:

	* src/find.c: drc: Fix polygon-polygon clearance checks IsPolygonInPolygon was applying 2x bloat to the line it uses to test
	with against the second polygon, and IsLineInPolygon was applying a
	further bloat offset - making the clearance used incorrect.  This caused false DRC violation reports of polygons being too close
	to one-another, despite there being adequate clearance.  Note for future - a cleaner fix regarding "Bloat", and the DRC, is
	that we should probably pass it more explicitly as a parameter where
	it is to be used, in order to avoid surprises as to where it gets
	applied.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk/gui.h: fix definition of
	LAYER_BUTTON_SILK LAYER_BUTTON_SILK should give the number of the layer after all
	copper layers. Since the copper layers are enumerated starting with
	zero, this is equal to the number of copper layers MAX_LAYER.  The previous definition erreously added LAYER_BUTTON_SILK to this
	number.  This only worked, because src/const.h sets this constant to
	zero.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Fix the recent addition of smartdisperse.c.  Before committing something, please run a 'make distcheck'. This is
	considered to be the most safe way we have to make sure there is no
	regression.  If this isn't possible, please build with and without NLS and run a
	'make check' each time. Like:   ./autogen.sh && ./configure --disable-nls --disable-doc && make   make check   ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make   make check This is a bit more manual work but gives similar confidence.  All these tests pass now again.

	define the EXTRA_DIST variable for this directory. A rather complex

	tests/Makefile.am. This almost doubles the speed of compilation
	after small changes and reduces clutter sent to the command line a
	lot, so a great improvement for developers.  Creation of new tests is also simplified, creating a Makefile.am and
	editing configure.ac is no longer neccessary.  Previous versions of this commit used wildcards to include new tests
	automatically. This strategy was discarded in favour of a
	hand-edited list, because some developers aren't exactly excited by
	using wildcards.  As we're on the topic, here are a few informative readings regarding

	* w32/Makefile.am: w32/Makefile.am: refine the move to wildcards.  As per discussion in #geda IRC, liberal use of wildcards isn't
	exactly a good idea. Some even prefer to use no wildcards at all.
	Others want to make situations, where files are often added or
	removed, less forget-prone.  As a compromise, move towards more strict, unambiguous wildcards.

2015-09-15   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/Makefile.am: Makefile.am: refine the move from INCLUDES to
	AM_CPPFLAGS.  The key is apparently this sentence in the autoconf docs:  "AM_CPPFLAGS is ignored in preference to a per-executable   (or per-library) _CPPFLAGS variable if it is defined." Accordingly we have to add -I$(top_srcdir) to every target-specific
	*_CPPFLAGS.  This fixes a 'make distcheck' more, it builds now, but fails on the
	checks.

2015-09-15   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* w32/Makefile.am: w32/Makefile.am: use wildcards to include
	minipack stuff.  This should end the need for the often required commits to let the
	Makefile catch up with actual development.  This partially fixes 'make distcheck', it runs a lot further.

	This '2' usually means the number of all layers, including the silk
	ones. Using fixed values in such cases is less than ideal.  To relax the situation, SILK_LAYER was introduced to mark all these
	places by using 'SILK_LAYER' instead of using a plain 2.  Great
	efforts were done to find them, I hope it's complete.  Additionally, MAX_ALL_LAYER was introduced to replace 'MAX_LAYER +
	2'. This shall mark these places for grepping.  A pure refactoring, behaviour should be exactly identical.  Well, except that in 2 or 3 places I was pretty sure a choosen array
	size of MAX_LAYER was too small and should be MAX_ALL_LAYER.  These
	size increases were done. So, behaviour should be actually more
	reliable.

	Layer flags: revert the concept of layers having a "side".  Removing features? This deserves an explanation: 1. The whole current concept of gEDA/pcb is that physical layers    map not to single virtual layers, but to layer groups.     Accordingly, and this is the strongest reason for this revert,    all layers in a group and the group its self hold the same    information and have to be kept in sync. The need to keep    a whole bunch of locations synchonized is a can of worms I    do not want to open.  2. The above isn't going to change, unless the concept of groups    is given up.  3. GUI and exporters code have currently a pretty complicated    system of finding layer types, so solving this first and    postponing reckoning the similarly complicated mechanism for    finding the side is a good idea.  4. Pulling out type finding code will also make a lot of the group    handling code obsolete.  5. The implementation found in the patch mixed properties 'side'    and 'type' into a single variable by using bitfields. Requiring    bit mask decoding is slower and, because it was done by manual    masks instead of C bitfields, error prone.  6. Additional layer properties, like 'side' or even 'color' can be    added later without much hassle, so if it turns out this commit    was a poor decision, catching up then is likely even easier    then pulling through both at once now.  7. "Do one thing at a time and do this right!" :-)

	closely. No longer, rotated square pads appear now fine at any zoom
	level.  Some whitespace editing by me, Traumflug, after applying the patch.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c,

	preferences as well.  For some unknown reason, all windows stored height as well as width,
	but the netlist window only height. Now it's consistent.  This also solves a Gtk assertion failure, as setting a window width
	of -1 isn't allowed. Still missing is a default size.

	Refine the move from pcb_sprintf() to pcb_snprintf().  Using 'const' variables to define buffer sizes wasn't a good idea,
	such variables aren't really constant in C. It works for stack-

	documentation in the commandline window, SetThermal() required a
	second parameter.  The other broken thing was parsing that value, which is just an
	index into a list, but was interpreted like a coordinate given in
	centimil.  Both are fixed and on top of this, 'style' is now omittable.
	There's a default style in every layout, so no need to stress the

	DIP).  IMO SOT325 should be renamed to SOT-353-1 --> SOT353, or SC-88A

	* src/file.c: Write grid size with units.  Apparently this was forgotten earlier.  Reading/parsing code unchanged, so no compatibility issues expected.
	Also not considered to be a file format change, because values are

	file format must be capable of reading units already.  This was found when hand-editing a testcase for LP1022076, the grid
	size was saved to "funny" numbers, breaking regression tests.

	* src/action.c: src/action.c: make Rolands patch for MinMaskGap()
	complete.  Moved to a more general solution. Instead of looking at the Hole
	flag, the mask offset is now always related to the bigger of
	Thickness and DrillingHole.  Also applied the same for vias, which are the GUI way of defining
	holes.  Last, all this in only applied if a mask hole existed before at all.
	Typical non-mounting-hole vias are fully covered by solder resist.

2012-09-13   Robert Drehmel * robert AT zoot dot drehmel dot com *

	* src/action.c: MinMaskGap() should care about holes.  MinMaskGap() should care about holes as it does about pins, pads,
	and vias. Otherwise, fab houses might complain because the solder
	mask doesn't have enough distance to holes.  The problem in detail: ActionMinMaskGap() checks whether the hole's thickness plus the
	specified minimum mask gap is larger than the currently set mask
	value. If so, it sets the new mask to be the hole's thickness plus
	the specified minimum mask gap value. ActionMinMaskGap() should
	check a hole's drilling diameter and base the mask calculation upon
	that.  This patch fixes the issue.  ... only for pins declared as hole. --Traumflug

	* antifork/antifork.sh: Antifork: get away without checkouts.  This is not only faster and leaves less garbage behind, it also

	ever work, because there is only one such variable globally.  How
	should this work if the exporter and some GUI part wants to printf()
	something at the same time? Clash.  The standards comittees very apparently simply forgot or ignored
	that not all printf() output is meant to be human readable. Bummer.  I almost imported an older printf() implementation to have one
	ignoring the locale, but then I found g_ascii_formatd() on Glib.
	This line works independently from the locale:   char b[100];   fputs(g_ascii_formatd(b, 100, "%3.2f\n", 125.646), stdout); Fine. Now we know on how to go ahead.  Regarding regression tests: 'make check' passes now without NLS (it
	didn't before), but fails even uglier with NLS enabled.  Both on a
	system with de_DE locale.

	* configure.ac: Don't configure with AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.  As the automake manual explains it's self, maintainer mode
	intentionally attempts to build old, possibly broken code:
	https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/maintainer_002dmode.htmlThe manual also explains why this is a bad idea:  "If one user has to modify a Makefile.am, then either   Makefile.in should be updated [...] but the last thing you   want is that nothing happens and the user doesn’t notice it   (this is what happens when rebuild rules are disabled by   AM_MAINTAINER_MODE)." It also sees a reason why this pitfall is kept at all:  "it [still] helps them working on projects where all files are   kept under version control" However, gEDA/pcb does NOT keep these generated files under version
	control.  That said, maintainer mode can be enabled at any time by passing

	* src/change.c, src/change.h, src/global.h: Revert "Introduce
	dynamic board size." This reverts commit d91daad65c3ea7e2e1b6ce876b7d41550f6a784e.      The goal is to eventually define the board's extent by the
	    outline layer, only. That way, all the exporters can export
	    properly sized layouts.      Undoubtly, this can also influence the GUIs. For example, "zoom
	    to fit" becomes a slightly different meaning and drawing outside
	    the board's extent becomes possible. Autorouting and similars can be
	    limited to the actual board size. Resizing a board to the lower left
	    no longer requires the error-prone moving of all the stuff and keeps
	    file diffs small.  The code in question does NOT dynamically update the desired
	information when the outline layer changes, and it adds yet more
	 magic meaning to the "outline" layer which I'm trying slowly to
	remove from PCB. This is the wrong way to cope with unlimited board
	sizes.

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: hid/gcode: Don't use
	PCB->Extent{Min,Max}{X,Y}.. they are about to be killed The extent updating code is broken, and adds yet more special-case
	code which handles the "outline" layer. Use PCB->MaxWidth and
	PCB->MaxHeight, these represent the size the of board, and are the
	values which the extents code defaulted to if it did not find any
	lines on the "outline" layer.

	* src/line.c, src/misc.c, src/misc.h: Remove function

	special-case handling in the deleted function to force returning
	max_group if passed layer number "max_copper_layer".  This actually (as it happens), corresponds to the bottom silk layer,
	and this handling is suspect at best. GetLayerGroupNumberByNumber()
	will return the group corresponding to the bottom of the board
	(whichever that may be).

	depending on usage We used the {COMPONENT,SOLDER}_LAYER constants for two distinct
	meanings: 1. To identify board sides, ie. use as an integer constant
	representing top / bottom 2. As an offset at the end of the layer array to index the two
	silk-screen layers Split the usage of these constants as appropriate, so the difference
	in meaning is clear. {TOP,BOTTOM}_SIDE are used where we need an
	integer constant (1 and 0 respectively) refering to the side of the
	board. This is used, for example, as a side specifier in draw.c, and
	for indexing arrays of pads per board-side in find.c.  Usage as an offset into the layer for referencing the silk-screen
	layers is now {TOP,BOTTOM}_SILK_LAYER. The relevant offset of
	PCB->LayerN must still be added.

	ALLOW_MM.  This patch replaces the constant with a function call
	whose return value can be changed at runtime. (By default the
	function returns the old ALLOW_READABLE value, so this commit makes
	no user-visible changes.) In a later commit I will add a user-settable option to change the

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix lockup
	when a scroll event is received outside the drawing area This can occur if the user is dragging a component in the drawing
	area (hence a pointer grab is in operation), and during this drag,
	the user moves the mouse outside the drawing area and touches the
	scroll wheel.  We then hit the scroll event handler, mouse action handler, action
	dispatcher etc.. and find we do not have a current location known.
	(The cursor is outside the drawing area).  We then prompt for a
	location, and using a recursive main- loop, wait for some kind (e.g.
	a mouse click) which gives one.  The problem appears to be caused by the fact it is likely we get a
	second scroll event with the first, and that we process this from
	within the recursive main-loop. We are still outside the drawing
	area, so prompt the user for a location, and enter another level of
	recursion. (In my tests, I was able to hit 6 or 7 levels deep of
	main-loop recursion).  Our code fails to exit its recursive main-loop if it rucurses, and
	in any case, we would not want to prompt the user "n" times in a
	row. The failure to exit from recursion is probably due to the event
	handlers attached by the first recursive main-loop being called
	prior to those attached later. (We attempt to quit the first
	recursive main-loop, but cannot, as there are others now running).  As a quick work-around to the immediate problem, prevent scroll
	events being received from within the recursive main-loop. This
	prevents the lockup, but ideally we should re-think how we handle
	these events to avoid requiring the user to click on a coordinate.  I have also added a GDK_THREADS_{LEAVE,ENTER} pair around running
	the main-loop, as this is what GTK's code does for gtk_dialog_run().

	* src/find.c: find.c: Remove some "flag" variable usage in DRCFind() Avoid confusion by passing *FLAG constants directly to some
	functions.  This removes several cases where we would set the
	variable, use it once, then change it for the next usage, making the
	code more succinct.  I was not able to remove the flag variable entirely, as the while
	loop calling DoIt() relies on it being changed inside the loop in
	order to terminate. It should be possible to re-write the loop exit
	condition if desired, but I'm not sure I completely understand the
	behaviour of the existing code yet.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Fix possible un-assigned use of "flag" in
	DRCFind(), fix bloated test.  Caught by inspection.. no idea why the compiler didn't notice.  Before commit 4cbfadfb7a496e60c25f47c88bdb374b4d3777bb, our local
	"flag" variable was the file-global "TheFlag". If the "shrink" test
	was not run, the code called ClearFlagOnAllObjects() with the
	previously assigned "TheFlag". After the above commit, we would use
	"flag" unassigned.  If the shrink test is executed, the "FOUNDFLAG" is cleared from
	objects, leaving a SELECTEDFLAG image on the copper in question as a
	reference to compare against when considering the bloated geometry.
	(This is the wrong reference, as we should be comparing against the
	non-shrunk case).  If the shrink test was not run, we left no reference for the boated
	test.  We should clear FOUNDFLAG _and_ SELECTEDFLAG after the shrunk test,
	then construct a new reference to start with, using non-bloated
	geometry.  This partly fixes the behaviour of the bloated test, as it is now
	run against a non-bloated reference, not a shrunk reference. This
	fixes false reports of "Copper areas too close" for track objects
	encountered after a "Potential for broken trace" warning.  There are still other issues with the bloated DRC test. One
	important one is that it may run multiple times on the same geometry
	if a "Potential for broken trace" error is present, or if the
	"shrink" test is not run.  The repeated runs are because in the "Potential for broken trace"
	case, only part of the track (or none if we skip the shrink test)
	will get the DRCFLAG set. DRCFind then will be called repeatedly on
	all pins, pads and vias, despite having already touched the geometry
	with the bloated test.  To fix this, we need to separate the shrink
	and bloat tests into distinct passes, and set the DRCFLAG on objects
	during both tests. We can't simply set the DRCFLAG from the bloated
	test as it stands, as doing so would mask investigating "Potential
	for broken trace" cases after the first encountered.  An example of false "Copper areas too close" being fixed by this
	commit is the following test-case: FileVersion[20091103] PCB["" 65.000mm 15.0000mm] Grid[984.251969 0.0000 0.0000 1] PolyArea[3100.006200]

	* src/hid/png/png.c: png: --fill-holes Add an option to the PNG exporter to draw pin/via drill holes as
	filled instead of hollow, for use with CNC machines that don't need
	a "helper" hole in the copper.  Also fixed a doc typo.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Use SetThing, rather than open-coding
	assignments to thing_* I'm trying to identify all uses of SetThing and similar consructs,
	so I can eventually kill them.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Remove unnecessary PIN/VIA test from
	SetThing() This is not needed since commit
	d581a90edc7fb7c0b4c6351611cc4a6689d7620b which put similar code into
	ADD_PV_TO_LIST(), the only caller which could have previously
	resulted in a SetThing call with the wrong type.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Test for libgd once, not per HID which
	uses it.  This avoids some repeated tests, so should help to speed up the
	configure process a little. This commit also enforces testing for
	the required PNG support in libgd if the gcode or nelma HIDs are
	selected.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Remove CC_OR_CXX_FLAGS substitution
	from configure.ac

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/Makefile.am: src/Makefile.am: We don't gain anything by
	setting AM_CFLAGS to C_OR_CXX_FLAGS We were duplicating command-line flags un-necessarily, and it does
	not stop the a build with the C++ compiler using CFLAGS, as was (in
	hindsight) the original intention before commit
	72cdf2ecef3361a00fbd0ee3e540f7383e62272c where I changed a complete
	CFLAGS override to a AM_CFLAGS addition.  As we should not override CFLAGS in a Makefile (it prevents the user
	from setting CFLAGS at "make" time), I'm removing this completely.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Use CPPFLAGS, not CFLAGS for our
	include directives.  We were previously using CFLAGS for adding pre-processor includes,
	where these should really end up in the CPPFLAGS variable.
	Confusingly, their constituents tend to come from variables set by
	autoconf / pkgconfig expansions in the form of LIBNAME_CFLAGS.  Doing this allows the user to easily override CFLAGS at build time
	without needing to replicate the enture include path list.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Save and restore CPPFLAGS either side
	of test for libgd Ensure we add GD_CFLAGS to the the main flag list later instead.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Don't add GD_CFLAGS to CFLAGS, only
	CPPFLAGS GD_CFLAGS will almost certainly contain pre-processor flags, not
	strictly compiler flags, and we don't need to have a copy in CFLAGS
	as well.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Save and restore CPPFLAGS either side
	of test for X11 stuff We add X_CFLAGS and X_LIBS to the main flag list later, so don't
	leave an extra copy lying around in the CPPFLAGS variable.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Don't copy CFLAGS into CPPFLAGS for
	X11 tests CFLAGS should work in its own right, and CPPFLAGS does not need a
	copy.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: configure.ac: Don't add win32 build flags to
	CPPFLAGS as well as CFLAGS These are compiler flags only, not preprocessor flags.

2013-01-03   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* configure.ac: Remove CYGWIN_CFLAGS and CYGWIN_CPPFLAGS from
	configure.ac We no longer ship a build-script which requries these. Any specific
	CFLAGS for a given build should be overridden by specifying CFLAGS
	at configure or make time.

2013-01-01   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: hid/gcode: Add a more direct "#include
	<locale.h>" for setlocale() The lack of this include caused a failure to build on my machine
	when compiled without optimisation (-O0). With any optimisation
	turned on, the build would work without the include.  Having chased this strangeness down, it turns out that we were
	including libintl.h via global.h, and that libintl.h includes
	locale.h, IFF optimisation is turned on at the time it is
	pre-processed.

2013-01-01   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Remove some unnecessary includes.

	* src/main.c: Change FOUND objects colour from green to purple...  Aim to differentiate the region connected to the search origin from
	those which should be (but are not yet) connected to it.

2012-12-10   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/action.c: Tag physically/logically connected items differently
	in the "Find" action This commit restores the semantic meaning of the "found" flag to
	what it was before commit 764c3560a722c768a7048f5c70811ec363862882,
	and uses the "connected" flag to identify which of the "found"
	(logically connected) items are physically connected to the search
	origin.  The aim here is to differentiate between what an ohm-meter would
	show connected with the board as-currently designed, and what it
	would read if all rat-lines were implemented.

2012-12-24   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Use pointers to objects, not shallow copies of
	their structures Since commit 4658e4074b4446337467f99fa2b8f9b7147e7e01, we don't
	modify the copied objects, so we can use pointers instead.

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/action.c, src/gpcb-menu.res.in, src/pcb-menu.res.in: Add
	option to "Select" action, differentiating "FOUND" and "SELECTED"
	objects The exising "Select" action included the variant
	"Select(Connected)", which selected any object with the "FOUNDFLAG"
	set.  As we now make a distinction between logical and physical
	connectivity (FOUND and SELECTED) respectively, this commit
	introduces a split into "Select(Found)" and "Select(Connected)"
	variants.  There is a change here, in that "Select(Connected)" now acts on
	objects with the CONNECTED flag set, (not the FOUND flag as it did
	previously).

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/draw.c, src/undo.h: draw.c: Support for coloring objects with
	CONNECTEDFLAG set We now color objects with the FOUNDFLAG set in the FoundColor, not
	the ConnectedColor as we did previously. Unsurprisingly, objects
	with the CONNECTEDFLAG set get rendered in the ConnectedColor.  CONNECTEDFLAG is tested before FOUNDFLAG, and takes precidence if an
	object has both flags set.

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/create.c, src/global.h, src/main.c: Add FoundColor to resource
	settings, distinct from the Connected color For now, set ConnectedColour and FoundColor to the same green, so we
	can introduce this patch series without flip-flopping the renderered
	colours.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/const.h, src/strflags.c: Add a new flag, "connected" /
	CONNECTEDFLAG.  The intended use of this flag is to mark physical connections.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Avoid adding any rat-lines at all when AndRats
	is false.  Previously we were adding some rat-lines when searching for physical
	connections. We should stop at the physical->rat boundary, not the
	opposite end of the ratline.

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Fix inverted logic in LookupConnection() When AndRats is true, we may consider starting with a ratline
	object, otherwise we do no. I got this backwards by mistake.

2012-12-25   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Remove file-global "IsBad", use
	PlowsPolygons() return value.  This variable was used to communicate state from the drc_callback(),
	however PlowsPolygons() returns the sum of the values returned by
	its callback function. As our callback returns 0 on success, 1 on
	DRC failure, we know any non-zero return from PlowsPolygons()
	implies a DRC problem.

2012-12-24   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Avoid modifying bounds of the objects we are
	passing down Bloat the bounding box into a local BoxType structure instead, to
	avoid passing inconsistent objects to lower level functions.

2012-12-27   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Avoid repeated lookup of layer pointer by

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/buffer.c, src/const.h, src/copy.c: Add #define list of flags
	to unset when copying into a buffer Previously, the removal of FOUNDFLAG was hard-coded in various
	places, lets consolidate the location to one header file, as when we
	split the FOUNDFLAG to differentiate logical and physical
	connectivity, we will only have one location to update.

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: (GL) Disable scissor test for

	as we are not painting the entire buffer we are swapping onto the

	revisiting to address what is really going on here.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: Disable GL alpha-blending for

2012-12-23   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: (GL) Start with the stencil test

	* src/buffer.c, src/copy.c, src/create.c, src/create.h,
	src/parse_y.y: create.c: Remove Element parameter to
	CreateNewElement() Lets always make a new element, not re-use old memory. It seems
	saner to do this when we have an API with "New" in the name! No callers use the facility to fill in a pre-allocated (or already
	used) ElementType structure any more.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/parse_y.y: parse_y.y: Pass NULL explicitly to
	CreateNewElement(), rather than via yyElement This makes things clearer.

	* src/buffer.c, src/copy.c, src/copy.h,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-pinout-preview.c: copy.c: Remove "Dest" variable to

	hid/gtk: Make the pinout preview element use dynamicly allocated

	forcing various element initialisation and copy routines to be
	require operating on a pre-allocated ElementType - rather than just
	returning us a pointer to a newly allocated ElementType.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/mymem.c: mymem.c: Allow elements to exist independently of a
	buffer.  If the DataType pointer to GetElementMemory is NULL, we allocate
	memory but don't add to the buffer's element list or counters.  This is useful as it will allow rendering of pinout previews without
	needing separate (or static) memory allocation to hold the previewed
	Element.

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Always draw pin / hole names when in pinout

2012-12-22   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/select.c: select.c: Rename "Flag" to "select" for clarity.  This will help avoid confusion when adding a "flag" parameter to

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/netlist.c,

	flag parameter to RatFindHook() API.  This saves us having to expose an API to save and restore the find.c
	static "theFlag" variable.  The key difference (once the save/restore are removed), is that we
	then won't restore "TheFlag" variable after we are done. This will
	not matter as all entry-points in find.c now take a flag parameter
	and there should not be reentrancy in these calls.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/netlist.c: (GTK, Lesstif): Netlist window - Set find flag to FOUNDFLAG
	explicitly Our "Select net" functionality depends on find.c's "TheFlag"
	variable being set to FOUNDFLAG. In some circumstances (e.g. after a
	DRC check), this may not be the case, and selecting nets from the
	netlist window breaks.

2012-12-14   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/select.c: select.c: Set an explicit flag to search using when
	selecting nets by name If find.c's "TheFlag" variable is not equal to FOUNDFLAG, our code
	for selecting nets by name did not work. This could happen, for

	it, and we don't have any other requirement to clear flags.  Futhermore, as toporouter.c does not setup which flag is being
	operated on, the effect of this call will depend on which flag has
	been left in "TheFlag" variable in find.c.

	* src/autoroute.c: autoroute.c: Remove unnecessary call to
	ResetConnections() This is not required to call CollectSubnets, (as the rats.c internal
	function GatherSubnets() cleans the flag from objects before it uses
	it).  We also use DRCFLAG to mark nets in CreateRouteData(), however: 1. We should be able to assume the DRCFLAG is clear on all objects
	   at the point we un-necessary to reset it.  2. We call GatherSubnets() after we reset the DRCFLAG contents, and    that leaves the objects in a clean state without that flag set.

	* src/action.c, src/find.c, src/find.h, src/netlist.c, src/report.c: 
	Stop "find connected" following rat-lines. Fixes confusing output.  Suppose we have two nets, A and B, and some components. If we
	connect a pin of a component which was supposed to be connected to
	net A, to net B, the "f" (find connected) action will falsely show
	the entirity of net A and net B connected to each other. In reality,
	the nets are not electrically connected, it is just the ratline
	between the mis-connected component pin (mis-connected to Net B),
	and net A, where the ratline for that pin should end up.  It MIGHT be better if we fix this bug by not adding rat-lines to
	shorted connections, as often those rat-lines would take some
	convoluted route through the copper of the net which is shorted to
	that connection end-point. These rat-line(s) would no longer be
	spatially associated with the mis-connected wiring, and encourage
	the user to further short net A and net B together to complete the
	ratline.  This bug was a contributing factor to a mistake in a production
	board I made recently, where as a last step in production, I added a
	star- ground short between two different ground planes (analogue and
	digital).  The "find connected" action, "f" showed them connected
	together (as I expected), but unfortunately, due to a thermal I left
	out, they were not actually connected - despite PCB's green
	rendering suggesting that they were.

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: don't drill drillmill holes.  Actually, this just avoids writing out the drill G-code file for

	written files.

2010-12-03   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: implement drill-milling.  This is, if a hole is equal or bigger than the milling tool, use the
	milling tool instead of a drill tool to manufacture the hole. Big
	advantage is, milling tools can create holes of arbitrary sizes by
	moving a circle.  The feature is optional, on by default.  G02/G03 circle movements are avoided, as not all machine controllers
	understand them. Instead, a polygon is milled, with enough sides to
	stay for any hole size  within the user choosen accuracy.  If the hole is only slightly bigger than the mill tool, don't move
	the circle; a simple plunge is enough.

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: reorder user interface to a more

	milling - output options.  Also completed the term "mill" to "iso-mill", as outline milling is
	around the corner.  Default measurement unit changed to mm, as I'm not aware of a single

2012-08-22   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: simplify the backside flipping

2012-08-20   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: make G-code output aware of
	dynamic extents.  This also offsets the produced G-code so the rectangular edge
	closest to {0, 0} in pcb is {0, 0} in the G-code. Very useful when
	actually producing boards.  The most simple way to achieve this is to draw just the part inside
	the outline into the intermediate image. No change to the PNG tracer
	needed.  Unfortunately, this exposes a bug, making the traced PNG image
	inverted. This will be fixed with the next commit.

2012-08-13   Kai-Martin Knaak * kmk AT lilalaser dot de *

	* src/hid/ps/eps.c: make EPS boundingbox parameters integers
	Currently, the bounding box parameters given in the header of an EPS
	file are floats. The standard calls for integers, though. Some
	applications like epstool fail if the boundingbox is anything but
	integer. This patch uses llrint() to output the nearest integer as
	bounding box parameters. In addition, it adds a high resolution
	header for the benefit of applications that can use the extra
	precision.   Example of the bounding box lines produced by the patch:  %%BoundingBox: 0 0 370 426  %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.000000 0.000000 369.503937 426.196850  Closes-bug: lp-1035999

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: make gcode_toolradius an int.  It's always used as such.

2012-08-19   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/change.c, src/change.h, src/global.h: Introduce dynamic board
	size.  The goal is to eventually define the board's extent by the outline
	layer, only. That way, all the exporters can export properly sized
	layouts.  Undoubtly, this can also influence the GUIs. For example, "zoom to
	fit" becomes a slightly different meaning and drawing outside the
	board's extent becomes possible. Autorouting and similars can be
	limited to the actual board size. Resizing a board to the lower left
	no longer requires the error-prone moving of all the stuff and keeps
	file diffs small.

2012-07-15   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: write drill size into the file,

2012-07-15   Markus Hitter * mah AT jump-ing dot de *

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode HID: implement predrilling Predrilling is using the milling tool to mark all drill spots. This
	eases and enhances accuracy of manual drilling.  This resolves patch #12 and obsoletes patch #11 and #13 of
	Traumflug's wishlist: https://bugs.launchpad.net/pcb/+bug/699497 The difference between patch #12 and this patch is, drills for
	predrilling are sorted regardless of size, so performance should be
	better.

	* src/rats.c: Remove manhattan check from rats.c Since commit 644f8d9, I cannot get the autorouter to segfault when
	it attempts to deal with ratlines connected to non-manhattan lines.
	So, I see no reason not to draw such lines in the first place.  However, when the autorouter is used, it will ignore any rats which
	lead to a non-manhattan line. (And therefore not connect two points,
	if the shortest connection would involve connecting diagonal
	traces.) This is unexpected behavior, though IMO no more unexpected than the
	old behavior, which was to ignore diagonal line segments and simply
	route amongst the manhattan ones.  Closes-bug: lp-699248

2012-03-29   Andrew Poelstra * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Fix segfault when routing to non-straight pads Since the autorouter does not handle non-manhattan lines, it will
	not route to non-straight pads. Therefore, when the autorouter
	searches for the pins/pads at the endpoints of a rat, it ignores any
	non-straght pads, returning NULL from the search.  The autorouter then tries to dereference this pointer and crashes.  The rest of the code, it seems, works to avoid ever giving such rats
	to the autorouter, but it can be done if the user explicitly selects
	such a rat and selects "Auto-route selected rats".  This patch catches the NULL pointer and simply ignores the rat.  It is possible that this is the cause of bug lp-699255, but this
	seems unlikely, since the backtrace on that report does not show the
	same NULL dereference, and the reporter was using "10-pin headers",
	which presumably have no pads that could be marked as non-straight.  Affects-bug: lp-699255

	* src/find.c: Fix infinite loop on PCB::skip-drc attribute When doing a DRC check, pcb skips checking any layers who have the
	PCB::skip-drc attribute set. However, when determining whether the
	check is complete (via the ListsEmpty()) function, it doesn't skip
	these layers.  The result is an infinite loop, since if there is work to be done on
	a skip-drc layer, the checker will keep running until it is done --
	i.e., will keep running forever.  This patch skips skip-drc layers in ListsEmpty().  Closes-bug: lp-829123

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c, src/pcb-printf.c,
	src/pcb-printf.h: Add grid-increment-mm (and similar) settings Added the following settings:   grid-increment-mm       grid-increment-mil   size-increment-mm       size-increment-mil   line-increment-mm       line-increment-mil   clear-increment-mm     clear-increment-mil These behave differently than the old settings of the same names
	(from 20090929 and earlier). They take a measure, not a real number.
	The -mm versions affect the increment settings when the user is
	using a metric grid, and the -mil versions affect the settings for
	imperial grids.  Old ~/.pcb/preferences files likely have lines like   grid-increment-mil = 5 which have been hanging around for several pcb versions. These
	should be safely ignored, since, for example, "5" is now read as
	"5nm", which is well below the minimum allowed increment setting.  These settings can be read but (so far) not written out, either to
	the pcb or to the preferences file.

	* src/gpcb-menu.res.in, src/pcb-menu.res.in: Change menus to use
	user's settings for increments

2012-03-27   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/action.c: Allow '+' and '-' (without magnitudes) for
	user-preference in menu This does not actually change any menu files, just adds the
	capability to use the user's settings in the Increments dialog for
	controlling pcb.

2012-03-26   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/misc.c: Check sscanf() return value in GetValue().  In case the user passes something like "+" with no digits to
	GetValue, sscanf fails and the function returns an indeterminate
	result. This patch fixes that, returning 0 instead if sscanf fails.

2012-03-26   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/change.c: Remove empty if statement from change.c git blame dates an empty-body if statement back to 2003, so (presumably) the correct behavior is that it be empty. Therefore, I
	removed the if to avoid confusing humans.  After this commit, pcb compiles completely and cleanly with:   clang version 2.9 (tags/RELEASE_29/final)   gcc version 4.6.2 20111027 (Red Hat 4.6.2-1)

	* src/res_parse.y: Add missing const in res_parse.y

2012-03-26   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/djopt.c: Remove superfluous check that unsigned int is
	nonnegative.  It seems to me that we'll sooner fix layer management altogether,
	than change an index from an unsigned to signed variable. And in the
	meantime, this check is unnecessary and potentially confusing.

2012-03-26   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/change.c: Change no-ops from self-assignments to (void) casts This makes both clang and gcc happy (with nothing, both complain
	about unused variables, and clang doesn't like the self-assignment).  splint still complains, but I think we'll have to live with that.

2012-03-26   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c: Add missing cast in hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c

	* src/parse_y.y: Fix segfault when reading Layer() with no name When reading pcb file with a line like   Layer (2 "") the lexer gives us a NULL in place of the empty string, which caused
	a NULL-dereference and segfault. This patch allocates a new ""
	string when reading nameless layers.  See

	* src/gpcb-menu.res.in: Standardize gtk-menu Changes some names of menu-items. Also reodered some of them. This
	will normalize the menu items to more closely follow modern menu
	conventions like the Gnome user interface guidelines.  Closes-bug: lp-907040

2012-03-02   Felix Ruoff * Felix AT posaunenmission dot de *

	* doc/pcb.texi: actualize outdated menu-docu actualized some documentation for the menue. Some items has changed
	their name and/or location in the past which was not changed in the
	documentaion.

2012-03-02   Felix Ruoff * Felix AT posaunenmission dot de *

	* doc/pcb.texi: Actualize docu for (g)pcb-menu.res.in Today, pcb checks for more than one keyword in the
	(g)pcb-menu.res.in: "Main Menu" and "Mouse".

2011-12-18   Vladimir Zhbanov * vzhbanov AT gmail dot com *

	* src/main.c: Fixed command line batch output for some exporters This problem affects some exporters: gcode, eps, ps, nelma, probably
	gerber (although it should already have been fixed for it). When
	building pcb with non-C locale, pcb uses for output this locale's
	settings. With locales using comma as numeric separator it causes
	the wrong output for those formats. The problem does not affect an
	export from GUI.  Closes-bug: lp-905968

2012-01-20   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/line.c: Fiddle with the 45-degre line snapping code The results should be identical, but hopefully this is clearer code.  I believe there were some masked bugs lurking in the old
	calculations, which shouldn't be present in the new code.

2012-01-21   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: Remove XOR colour logic from the

	* src/move.c: move.c: Fix off-by one in memory copy loop.  Shorten the loop so we don't don't try to memmove a zero length
	chunk off the end of our array. Might have been harmless, but lets
	not take the chance.  Rename some variables to make things a bit clearer as well.  (Caught by Coverity).  Coverity-CID: 12

	* src/buffer.c: Update the crosshair constraints after mirroring or
	rotating the buffer.  Avoids a bug where the paste location of the mirrored or rotated
	buffer contents are improperly constrained based upon their old
	bounding box.

2011-12-26   Peter Clifton * peter AT clifton-electronics dot co dot uk *

	* src/djopt.c: djopt.c: Fix incorrect allocation.  I missed this fix from the commit

	* gts/matrix.c, gts/refine.c, gts/split.c, gts/vopt.c: gts: Avoid
	performing computations with side-effects in g_assert statements g_assert (like assert), can be disabled at build time, so assertions
	should therefore not contain any expressions which have
	side-effects.  Coverity caught a number of these in the copy gts library we have
	embedded.  There were also a couple which coverity didn't complain
	about, which appear to be the same class of problem. Fix them by
	separating the computation and the assertion test, adding a
	temporary result variable as necessary.  Coverity-cid: 56 Coverity-cid: 57 Coverity-cid: 57 Coverity-cid: 58

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: hid/gtk: Avoid warnings when
	netlist window is not created.  1. When the NetlistChanged action is fired, we should only update if
	   the netlist window is visible. (It will be created up to date when
	   the user asks for it).  2. Always show the netlist window when requested, even if it has no    entries. This is good for consistent UI behaviour anyway, as the
	   user should be shown a blank netlist window if they request it..
	   even if the is no content to display.

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-cell-renderer-visibility.c: hid/gtk: Add subtle
	gradient effect to layer selector swatches Just because gradients are pretty ;)

2011-12-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: hid/gtk: Fix NetlistChanged
	action crash when exporting from the commandline.  I broke this in commit 7308f512307158944482227d58e66373fd023d62 when
	I added a missing notification to the GUI when free'ing the netlist.
	It turns out that a command-line invoked export (such as used to
	export images in the doc/ build) will hit this code-path, and
	provoke the GUI netlist window code to try and update before the GUI
	is actually loaded.  For now, lets fix this with a bandaid and just skip the netlist
	update if the GUI is not up.  A brief inspection of the code (and test for the doc/ build)
	suggests that the Lesstif HID is not affected by this problem. (It
	has similar code to avoid creating the netlist window if the main
	window is not already created).

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Move
	ghid_gui_is_up variable into the ghidgui structure.  This lets us access it outside of gtkhid-main.c

2011-12-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/mymem.h: Remove *TypePtr and *TypeHandle aliases

	so drop the aliases and hopefully keep things earier to follow.

	* src/action.c: action.c: Unconditionally notify NetlistChanged()
	when loading new netlist We need to call NetlistChanged() even if the loading failed,
	otherwise the GUI is not informed that we free'd the old netlist.

2011-12-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/mymem.c: Fix crash upon pressing "f" hotkey (find connected)
	after a board revert.  Reproduction of this crash (before fix!): 1. Load a PCB with a netlist.  2. Open the netlist window to initialise the netlist.  3. File->Revert the PCB 4. Hit "f" key whilst the croshair is over any pad Analysis: When you File->Revert the layout, the GTK GUI's netlist window is
	not cleared as the old layout is free'd (or as an equivalent cause..
	"NetlistChanged(0)" is not called the reverted layout is loaded).  Having had the netlist window open before the revert, the
	data-structures in the GUI are initialised, but point to the
	pre-revert layout. They are not explicitly updated with a
	"NetlistChanged" notification, so when the user next hits "f" for
	find, it will try to use the stale pointers it already had.  Fix: Call "NetlistChanged (0);" after free'ing the netlist memory. The
	"FreeNetlistMemory()" call only free's the individual nets, the
	parent netlist structure which points to that memory and identifies
	how many nets are present is zeroed by the FreeNetlistMemory() call,
	so we can safely call NetlistChanged() at this point, before we have
	reloaded a new netlist.

	* src/hid/common/hidgl.c: hid/common/hidgl.c: Simplify angle
	calculation for drawing line caps Make use of atan2 to avoid special casing horizontal lines, and move
	make the input variables doubles to be consistent with that
	function.  Our use of "tanl" was inappropriate for the float input,
	dobule output variables we were using before (spotted by Dan
	McMahill).  I have modified the semantic meaning of angle, to keep the more
	conventional angle = atan2 (dy, dx); geometry. This means the angle
	now refers to the angle of the line, not the angle of the line-cap
	start. (The angle is adjusted before passing into the cap drawing
	routines).

	* src/move.c: Update line RUBBERENDFLAG after move, even for trivial
	moves If you move a line segment, then drop it in its original place, the

	* src/buffer.c, src/create.c, src/global.h, src/polygon.c: Revert
	previous commit, only update clipping for visible buffers This also fixes the undo bug, but without the performance hit.  (It

	seen any, this should be okay.) Affects-bug: lp-699272

2011-12-21   Andrew Poelstra * asp11 AT sfu dot ca *

	* src/buffer.c: Clip polygons after moving between buffers When moving a polygon between buffers (i.e., from the undo buffer to
	the PCB->Data buffer or vice-versa), line- and via-clipping is not
	recalculated. This means that any elements drawn on a buffer before
	the polygon is moved there, will not clip the polygon.  One way (the only way, AFAIK) to make this happen is by bug
	lp-699272, which can reproduced as follows. I have inclided my
	explanation of what is happening at each step.    1. Draw a polygon with a line intersecting it, with clearpoly      set and visible clearance between the two.a   2. Delete the polygon. [This moves the polygon verbatim, including      its clipped form, from PCB->Data to RemoveList, the undo
	     buffer.]   3. Delete the line. [This moves it from PCB->Data to RemoveList,      calling RestoreToPolygon() to unclip any polygons on the screen      (but there aren't any!), then ClearFromPolygon() to clip the      polygon in the undo buffer (but this is already clipped!). In      other words, the line is deleted and the polygon unchanged.]   4. Hit undo. [This moves the line from the undo buffer back to      PCB->Data, calling RestoreToPolygon() to unclip the polygon in      the undo buffer, then ClearFromPolygon() to clip any polygons
	     on the screen (but there aren't any!). So the polygon is no
	     longer clipped.]   5. Hit undo. [This brings the polygon back, copying it verbatim
	     from the undo buffer to PCB->Data. As it is not clipped here, it
	     isn't clipped on the screen, giving rise to the "no clipping" bug.] This patch adds a call to InitClip() to MovePolygonToBuffer(), which
	forces a recalculation of a polygon's clipping when it is moved
	between buffers. This is perhaps not the most efficient fix, but
	will prevent any such synchronization bugs.  Closes-bug: lp-699272

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-route-style-selector.c: gtk: allow route style
	selector to have nothing selected The affects the the function ghid_route_style_selector_sync()
	function, which is called from the RouteStylesChanged action to keep
	the GUI in sync with pcb's state. It selects the route style that
	matches pcb's state, or if none exists, does nothing.  This patch replaces "does nothing" with "deselects all styles", so
	that the GUI will not be misleading.  Closes-bug: lp-699299

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-route-style-selector.c: gtk: fix memory leak in
	route style selector When the route style selector is emptied (e.g., when new styles are
	loaded from a .pcb file), any route style data not owned by pcb core
	is freed. However, this did not apply to all temporary route style
	data, even though the pcb core is completely unaware of those.  This commit frees all temporary route style data.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-library-window.c: gtk: library window: ignore
	element if LoadElementToBuffer fails In gtk/gui-library-window.c, the library window's selection-change
	callback calls LoadElementToBuffer() to read the selected element,
	so it can show a preview and select the element if necessary.  The return value of this determines whether to set pcb's mode to
	PASTEBUFFER_MODE. However, the library window preview is attempted
	regardless. If LoadElementToBuffer failed, this causes a NULL
	reference and segfault.  This patch skips the preview in the case that LoadElementToBuffer.  Closes-bug: lp-853628 Closes-bug: lp-852600

	* src/search.c: search.c: Return the pad who's center is closest to
	the queried coordinate When snapping to pads we often find the case where the search radius
	is wider than the spacing between pads. SearchPadByLocation()
	previously returned the first pad it found whthin the search area,
	meaning you could have the crosshair right above a particular pad,
	yet snap to a different pad due to it being within the search radius
	of the crosshair, and happening to be tested first by the r-tree
	search code.  This proof of concept change makes SearchPadByLocation() return the
	pad whos center coordinate is closest to the center of the search
	location.  This fixes another annoying snapping behaviour for some parts such
	as "0805", when operating with a fairly course grid. (NB: Search
	radius for snapping is related to the size of the current grid).

	* src/crosshair.c: crosshair.c: Be paranoid about overflow when
	finding an pad-center coordinates Not aiming to fix any particular bug here, but I noticed the

	perhaps ought to write some convenience functions for performing
	operations like this correctly.

2011-12-16   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/crosshair.c: crosshair.c: Snap to later-tested objects
	equi-distant with the current snap.  This inequality adjustment means that when an element mark is
	on-grid, and the first-snap is a grid location snap, the test
	against the element mark will now pass, and mark the snap as a
	non-grid snap.  This fixes the rather irritating bug where certain footprints, such
	as SMT resistors became impossible to grab by their element mark
	when that mark landed exactly on a grid point.

2011-12-15   Andrew Poelstra * asp11 AT sfu dot ca *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Fix plated-drill overflow bug in gerber.c Plated drills are printed in 1/10 mils rather than mils (it's a
	funny format). This was previously achieved by multiplying
	coordinates by 10, then printing them as mils. However, this caused
	an overflow for medium-large boards on 32-bit systems.  This fix just prints a trailing 0 onto the measures, rather than
	computing the value times ten.

	standards.  Note that the %mr specifier (which restricts suffixes to mm and mil
	so that old pcb versions can read them) uses this by default, so no
	changes need to be made to file.c.

	* src/hid/gcode/gcode.c: gcode exporter: reworked and cleaned up
	sort_drill() This function no longer deallocates the memory passed into it, which

	* src/file.c, src/set.c: Add attribute PCB::grid::size for user's
	grid setting This stores the grid size using pcb-printf for full precision; the
	ordinary value in Grid[] needs to be in cmils for backward
	compatibility, so it cannot store metric settings correctly.

2011-11-12   Richard Barlow * richard AT richardbarlow dot co dot uk *

	* src/pcb-printf.c: Fix parsing of route styles with units A bug appeared after route styles started being saved with units
	suffixed. When loading a PCB file the units were ignored and
	therefore it was assumed the values were in cmils.  This was a problem in the get_unit_struct() function which didn't
	handle long strings well. If the unit was followed by more
	characters strcmp would return non-zero. The function has already
	worked out the length of the unit text and therefore strncmp should
	be used.

	* src/file.c: Bump PCB_FILE_VERSION_BASELINE up to 20091103.  The unit-parsing support that we now require from the pcb parser was
	added by DJ in December 2008. So I am bumping up the output version
	in file.c to the next release, 20091103.

2011-10-23   Andrew Poelstra (local) * apoelstra AT wpsoftware dot net *

	* src/pcb-printf.c, src/pcb-printf.h: Make pcb-printf output unit
	suffixes with %mr spec This marks a change in the file format, but as we only use the mm
	and mil suffixes (for now, anyway), it should not be a breaking one.  I did not update the file format version that is output.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gdk.c, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: Fix
	pinout preview rendering for back-side elements NB: There are still some bugs, in that when the board view is
	flipped, this doesn't currently trigger a repaint of any preview
	widgets which are open. They will refresh with the updated
	coordinate system when they are next repainted. (Which might requre
	a resize of the window on a compositing window manager).  Ideally we would track the correct view with the preview widget, but
	for now this is a simple fix.

	* src/toporouter.c: toporouter.c: Re-write
	{coord,point}_intersect_prop() to increase clariry.  Since the wind_* values computed in this function can be -1, 0 or 1,
	it is clearer to test them using equality relations, not perform XOR
	operations on their bit-patterns.  I believe the old code worked, but it would return an strange
	constant for "true". To ram the point home, I've changed the
	function to return bool.

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/toporouter.c: toporouter.c: Replace coord_xangle() with
	coord_angle() The new function returning the "normal" coordinate system angle one
	would expect. Replace usage of coord_xangle() in
	export_pcb_drawarc() with the new function.  PCB's arc angles are a bit nutty, so lets try to contain that
	strangeness to the arc exporting routine!

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/toporouter.c: toporouter.c: Fixup and clean
	read_board_constraints() and create_board_edge() Introduce a #defined constant which expresses how fine to break the

	changed to nanometers).

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/toporouter.c: toporoute.c: Remove runtime Copyright message
	from toporouter Not only is Anthony now not the only author of this code, we don't

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/toporouter.c, src/toporouter.h: toporouter.[ch]: Add generic

2011-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/change.c: Revert "Change change.c to treat text scale as mils"
	and fix harder..  This reverts commit 9396377717f7c49cf38d753a35e32d004294b09e and
	fixes what was probably the underlying issue... I made a mistake in
	commit 2d21a8ad8f38e07b17450450a096f1ce4b3bef0e such that it added
	the existing text scale when setting an "absolute" text size, but
	ignored it when setting a relative change. (Clearly backwards).  Additionally, I've switched to computing the new value in double
	arithmetic to avoid a potential overflow when the input value is
	large and we are using a 32-bit Coord type.  See commit 2d21a8ad8f38e07b17450450a096f1ce4b3bef0e for a
	description of how text scale is defined and used. If we want to
	change how our text is sized / scaled in the future, we would need
	to change usage in many more places than the reverted commit
	touched.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: (GL Renderer) Use direct
	rendering for off-screen pixmaps We use direct rendering for the rest (where possible), so why slow

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-layer-selector.c,
	src/hid/gtk/ghid-layer-selector.h: hid/gtk: Layer selector - Rename
	"activatable" to "selectable" GTK has a special meaning for the word "activatable", meaning that

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-layer-selector.c: hid/gtk: Better encapsulate
	some of the layer selector initialisation The work we do within ghid_layer_selector_new() is better placed in
	the appropriate class initialiser functions, otherwise we needn't go
	to the trouble of subclassing a widget in the first place.

2011-09-29   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/ghid-layer-selector.c: hid/gtk: Don't refleak the

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: hid/gtk: Don't use dup_string where
	doing so would mix g_free() and free() The core uses malloc(), strdup(), free() etc..  The GTK HID
	primarily uses g_malloc(), g_strdup(), g_free() etc..  Mixing them can lead to bad behaviour and hard to debug crashes.
	This commit is not aimed at fixing any known bugs, but is "by

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: Simplify and correct
	ghid_show_crosshair() logic for the GL renderer Drop the always-true parameter we were passed, and combine the code
	from ghid_show_crosshair() and draw_crosshair() into one function.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gdk.c: hid/gtk: Remove always-true parameter
	from show_crosshair() in GDK renderer Pass the render_priv pointer instead - this is vaguely useful. Also
	tidy the function a little to make it clearer, rolling the code from
	show_crosshair() and draw_crosshair() together into a combined
	"draw_crosshair()" function.  The function no longer rejects negative x drawing coordinates, but
	we aren't passed those anyway.

	* src/pcb-printf.c: Move pcb-printf #if 0 guards for %mr specifier
	to fix internationalization Since the previous version of pcb cannot read files with suffixes on
	its measures, right now the %mr specifier outputs measures in cmils,
	no suffix.  The future behavior would be to select appropriate units and use
	those, but for now this is disabled by an #if 0 block around the
	relevant call to CoordToString.  This patch moves the #if 0 block to the suffix-specific part of the
	code, since we DO want the other behavior of the %mr spec,
	specifically, the forcing of '.' as a decimal separator.

2011-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/create.c: create.c: Don't emit RouteStylesChanged from within
	CreateNewPCB() The route style selector is hanging onto pointers of the current
	PCB's route styles. When the action "RouteStylesChanged" is called,
	these are compared against the current route style to identify which
	one the GUI should show as selected.  When this call comes from within CreateNewPCB, and the OLD PCB has
	already been free'd, this causes free'd memory to be read, resulting
	in valgrind output such as:     ==22404== Invalid read of size 8     ==22404==    at 0x4D82B3: ghid_route_style_selector_sync
	    (ghid-route-style-selector.c:594) ==22404==    by 0x4BAB28:

	    (vg_replace_malloc.c:366) ==22404==    by 0x4273DE: ActionNew
	(action.c:5901) Strictly speaking though - since CreateNewPCB does not directly
	assign to the current PCB variable - it has no business in calling
	the "RouteStylesChanged" action anyway.  Suitable update is taken care of later on in ActionNew(), as it
	calls the "PCBChanged" action - the GTK implementation of which in
	turn updates the route selector correctly.  Closes-bug: lp-856909

2011-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c: action.c: Set PCB = NULL; after freeing it in
	ActionNew() When we call CreateNewPCB(), it trips over some code which wants to
	access the current PCB in order to determine whether to auto-save at
	exit. The code in question does check if PCB is NULL first, so this
	is a sufficient fix for this case.  Fixes valgrind output such as:     ==22404== Invalid read of size 8     ==22404==    at 0x470944: Parse (parse_l.l:282)     ==22404==    by 0x471913: ParseFont (parse_l.l:356)     ==22404==    by 0x447973: CreateDefaultFont (create.c:941)     ==22404==    by 0x447C58: CreateNewPCB (create.c:211)     ==22404==    by 0x4273E8: ActionNew (action.c:5902)     ==22404==  Address 0xd3c4538 is 14,104 bytes inside a block of

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: hid/gtk: Fix Pan action to stop after
	button release outside window Previously, we required in-view coordinates to stop and start the
	pan-action, and when the button was released outside the viewport,
	the code was querying the user to click at a particular location.  Since the pan action doesn't even use the passed in coordinates,
	simply remove the requirement for the x-y coordinates from this
	action.  Closes-bug: lp-699307

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: hid/gtk: Set the LC_NUMERIC locale
	to "C" rather than "POSIX" This value is supported on Win32 platforms, whereas "POSIX" doesn't
	appear to have any effect.  This was one possible way to fix the "zoom doesn't work" bug on
	Win32 for locales which use "," as the decimal separator.  DJ fixed the Zoom action to be locale independent in commit
	fd5399c67b988f2f7c9d1a0b4ab7c13bc2e95158, which worked around the
	problem for this particular action, but I feel it would be best that
	we made our locale handling consistent between Linux and Win32 as
	well.  Affects-bug: lp-843577

	* src/file.c, src/main.c: Skip the M4 library on Windows On Windows, set the LibraryContentsCommand to the magic string
	"*NONE*" and check for that string while loading the libraries.
	This avoids the windows pcb.exe from trying to run bash or m4
	scripts, which are normally not available, yet allows the user a way
	to re-enable them if they want.

2011-09-16   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c: De-localize
	zoom parsing The values used for Zoom() were being parsed with strtod(), which
	switches between '.' and ',' depending on locale.  Switch to
	g_ascii_strtod() which always uses '.' and thus always matches our
	actions.  Note: I didn't change the command line parsing, because I didn't
	think we should impose '.'-centric syntax on other locales.

2011-09-16   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* lib/generic.list: Add DIL footprint names and R025.  Existing tutorials say to use "DIL 16 300" for DIPs (we use "N 16
	300") and often call for the R025 footprint, so add them as aliases
	so the m4-to-newlib converter includes them.

2011-09-16   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh: Fix m4-to-newlib converter filenames The m4 library uses macros and parameters to describe footprints,
	which allows for a *very* flexible footprint naming scheme.  While
	it is impossible for pcb to know all valid footprint values, it does
	have a list of "standard" ones, and knows how to obtain those.
	However, the m4 to newlib converter wasn't using the same footprint
	naming convention as everyone else, so produced *.fp files that
	weren't always useful.  For example, there were a large number of
	300.fp files that all collided.  With this fix, the footprint name matches the value in [...] in the
	library window, which is what we tell people to use for the
	"footprint=" attribute anyway.

2011-09-15   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/report.c: report.c: Don't leave actions in the undo stack or
	change the user's flags Some actions in ReportNetLength*() would have been lumped in with
	whatever actions were next added to the undo stack. These functions
	also left the user's board with a different "FOUND" flags on various
	items.  In the case of the "Report(AllNetLenths)" action, a very long undo
	stack would be created, which is not very helpful to the user.  These changes hide the internal flag changes made during the net
	length calculation from the undo system.  We are able to get back to the inital board state because we save
	the operations caused by our initial RestConnections() on the undo
	stack.  After we have done our work (modifying various flags in the
	process), we reset the flags again (this time bypassing the Undo
	system), so the board is consistent with the ResetConnections() call
	we DID save undo data for. We then Undo() these changes before we
	leave the function.

2011-09-15   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/report.c: report.c: Return 1 for all failure conditions in
	ReportNetLengthByName()

2011-09-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/undo.c: undo.c: Add error message where
	RestoreUndoSerialNumber() will break things If operations are addded to the undo stack between a call to
	IncrementUndoSerialNumber() and a subsequent call for
	RestoreUndoSerialNumber(), those added operations will be placed in
	the undo stack with an inconsistent serial number.  The {Save,Restore}UndoSerialNumber() API is pretty fragile in this
	regard, and we should avoid using it where possible.  An better alternative might be to implement a
	"LockUndoSerialNumber()" call which temporarily disables
	IncrementUndoSerialNumber(), and a "UnlockUndoSerialNumber()" call
	which re-enables its increment function.  Better yet - we could make these functions nestable, so we need not
	worry whether some action uses this new feature internally when we
	are also using it.

2011-09-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/undo.c: undo.c: Handle undo failures in a more sane manner Our current error-case handling can cause serial number
	inconsistency when something goes wrong when performing an Undo
	operation. There are also various logic flaws in our handling, as it
	only catches failures where every sub-undo operation with that
	serial number fails.  Remove the confusing do-loop which decrements the serial number in
	the failure case, and return some sensible error message instead.  This patch also removes the code which looked like it was intended
	to loop over the undo stack until a serial number was found to
	operate on.  It is advantageous for code like the DRC to be able to
	add increment the undo serial number, then safely perform an Undo -
	even if there were no changes logged in the undo system during the
	previous serial number.  Closes-bug: lp-848509

2011-09-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/undo.c: undo.c: Allow undo of locked objects Our internal actions can make changes to locked objects, then use
	the undo mechanism to revert these changes. An example is DRC, which
	changes flags on objects and uses the Undo system to restore their
	original values.  Affects-bug: lp-848509

2011-09-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/find.c: find.c: Remove stray RestoreUndoSerialNumber() calls These will cause havoc with the undo system, as we don't actually
	save a serial number to restore to.  Until a commit efd212c1deb264e9a7f2be17e9338fbb60e22cc0 we were
	saving a serial number at the start of each "ResetConnections
	(true);" call, and it would have been that serial number which got
	restored.  With this and some other fixes to the undo system, these restores
	are no longer required.  Affects-bug: lp-848509

	* src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: [lesstif] set units for styles dialog in

2011-09-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-gl.c: hid/gtk: Remove misplaced (and redundant)
	hidgl_flush_triangles() call.  If we were to flush the triangle buffer in ghid_show_crosshair(), we
	should do it before we set XOR mode on the GL context (assuming the
	buffer might be dirty when we are called), and we should do it after
	we finish drawing (if we wish to leave the buffer clean when we
	return).  The location the flush was in before this commit is just plain
	wrong.  As we currently have flushes of the triangle buffer wrapping the
	call to ghid_show_crosshair(), just leave the flushing out of this
	function.  Does this commit message provide an adequate example of simple
	patch, complex commit message phenomenon?

	auto-pan feature (kill it with fire).  This seems to be fairly universally unpopular on geda-user, and its
	implementation is a little fragile, often leading the board to pan
	off to some corner of the board as the poor user reaches for the
	layer selector or a menu without having remembered to click the
	feature off.  The fact that the pan direction and speed was set the instant you
	leave the drawing window also made it particularly unhelpful. A
	proper implementation should have grabbed the mouse - or at least
	implemented some buffer zone in which the mouse could be used to
	give feedback on the pan direction.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Reimplement file-change monitor without
	GFileMonitor I must have had a brain-fail when I hooked up setting up the
	file-changed monitor in the function which sets the window title.
	NB: That also gets called after every menu operation! A better place to hook up the monitor would be
	ghid_sync_with_new_layout(), however changing this alone revealed
	another issue - we would get notified for changes WE make to the
	files. We were avoiding those events as the file-monitor was being
	reset before it could pop up, at the end of the menu action which
	invoked the save).  However - due to a race condition bug in GLib / GIO, we would
	sometimes see change notify events for changes we made, even when we
	hooked up the GFileMonitor AFTER having saved (and synced) our
	changes to disk.  Rather than attempt to work around this bug, implement the
	file-change notification in a much more simple way - look at the
	file mtime when we update the layout, and at each time the mouse
	pointer enters the main window. FWIW, this is how gedit currently
	achieves the same feature.

	* src/action.c, src/file.c, src/file.h, src/hid/common/actions.c: 
	Implement a new RevertPCB() call, sharing code with LoadPCB() The RevertPCB() takes no filename parameter, and aside from that,
	the only difference to LoadPCB is that when it calls the GUI's
	"PCBChanged" action, it passes a new "revert" argument. This should
	let the GUIs optionally do less work resetting the view state for a
	board being reverted.

2011-09-06   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c, src/command.c, src/hid.h: Add a HID API call,

	saved into a different file.

2011-09-05   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/file.c, src/hid.h: Add a HID API call, notify_save_pcb()
	called around saving the PCB The intention of this API is so that GUIs monitoring the active PCB
	file on disk for changes, can filter out changes which occur as we
	save the file ourselves.

	could easily overflow on reasonably sized boards with a 32-bit Coord
	type.  The new code scales by (double)scale/100.0 instead.  Since we
	don't store scaled values in the PCB file, a loss of precision won't
	matter, but a double has 53 bits of precision - in nanometers,
	that's a board about the size of North America.  Closes-bug: lp-832451

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Fix
	styling of menubar area so it is consistent across its width This relies on some nasty tricks copying GtkStyle's between the
	menubar widget and a new GtkEventBox widget we pack the top bar in
	to give us a background to paint on. We also adjust the styles of
	the coordinate read- out labels and frames to ensure they are
	legible.  There may still be some inconsistencies, as the coordinate selector
	button is themed as if it were a toolbar button, hence the
	colourings used may be designed to work with a different background
	colour than we have.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Create a
	GtkToolbar of mode buttons for compact vertical mode Rather than packing our mode buttons into an hbox, use a proper
	GtkToolbar so theming will match the rest of the user's desktop.  This simplifies code to switch compact mode on and off, as we have
	two distinct widgets to show / hide, rather than having to reparent
	the mode buttons each time.  It does, however mean we have to be careful not to double-trigger
	events when keeping the two sets of mode buttons in sync with each
	other, so that isn't ideal.  In the longer term, we probably ought to split out the mode button
	area on the left-hand toolbar as a separate self-contained widget.

	with commit f903b4be6b85efc110852f7be40edf8245f0a513, which
	attempted to re-state the previous logic in a clearer fashon.  The logic now should: If flipping sides, and only ONE of the solder / component layers
	(groups) is visible, and that layer (group) is _active_, then swap
	the visibilities of the component / solder layers (groups), and make
	the newly visible layer (group) active.  There are still bugs in this code relating to the assumption that
	the first entry in the layer group is the one which is being
	toggled. This breaks if the first entry in the group is that
	corresponding to the silk for that side of the board.

	sync the menu checkboxes to the actual state of pcb, by checking the
	flags given in the resource file.  If this function is emitting signals and changing pcb's state, this
	is a bug. Fortunately, this appears not to be the case, so the
	effect of this commit is to eliminate one more use of
	ghidgui->toggle_holdoff.

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Fold DrawLayerCommon() into DrawLayer() Since the last commit, DrawLayer() just calls DrawLayerCommon with
	the "clear_pins" argument set to true. The only other

	functions is redundant.

	* src/draw.c: DrawLayer(): Pass true to clear_pins of

	set, we should only draw polygons, nothing more. Only a handful of
	cases draw layers via this code-path, and in all but the exporter
	cases, they are not called if CHECKPLANES is set.  The exporters which call DrawLayer explicitly clear the CHECKPLANES
	flag (since commit 3c01bd38cb59922692408b71cd5d77892dbe6ade), so
	nothing should be affected by this argument change.

	means that those accelerators DO NOT WORK. (This will be fixed in a
	later commit.) Checkboxes have been replaced with radio buttons
	where appropriate. There are now tearoffs on the context-menu's

	managed deletion and adding of layers. The new one has no notion of
	MAX_LAYER, nor does it care whether a layer is copper or not. :)

	* src/change.c, src/draw.c, src/report.c: Fix some text scale
	factors This commit fixes pin / pad name drawing, the pinout preview and two
	actions which change the size of text based on user input.  To recap: Text->Scale is a percentage scaling (from the font definition). The
	default font has has an approximate cap-height of 45-50 mils, and
	PCB assumes this to be the case.  Text->Scale is not a Coord, it is an integer, so use int as the
	resulting type for any calculations involving this number. (100% is
	stored as 100 in Text->scale). Code which scales text based upon
	other object sizes does so by dividing to a dimensionless scale
	factor. We may have to be careful about the width of intermediate
	results when scaling based on Coords if Coord is changed to 64bit at
	some point.  ChangeTextSize() and ChangeElementNameSize accept absolute (or
	delta) sizes in units of distance. These are converted to a Scale by
	assuming a 100% scaled font is 45mils high. YMMV.  Oh - and just to note.. the line-thickness is drawn at half the
	width stored in the font definition. This is clearly bonkers, but we
	would break designs if we changed it now. Grr.  (Thanks a bunch
	commit 66592387176ba2578dfc14023a6fe49226f3a3df).

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: 
	hid/gtk: Allow zooming out past the board size (up to 1/10 viewport
	size) The 1/10 viewport size should be the same as the Lesstif HID allows.
	The purpose of the limit is to avoid zooming in so small the PCB is
	lost as a tiny dot, and also to avoid coodinate overflows when
	representing screen coordinats in PCB Coords. (Since we switched to
	nanometers, this could potentially raise its head more readily until
	we move to 64bit integers).  The explicit pan fixup added to ghid_view_zoom_fit() is required as
	pan_common() no longer clamps the view back to the origin.

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Remove ghid_port_ranges_pan for new
	replacement ghid_pan_view_rel ghid_pan_view_rel() does less heavy lifting directly, sharing common
	code with the other view altering routines for zooming and panning.

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Remove prototype for non-existant
	ghid_port_ranges_update_ranges The functionality this prototype implies is in
	ghid_port_ranges_scale().

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: hid/gtk: Don't recompute view size in
	PCB coords in ScrollAction() We aleady keep around the view size in PCB coords, so use it
	directly.

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: hid/gtk: Add fixup for stored
	gport->pcb_{x,y} coords when changing view This updates the stored (in PCB coordinates) mouse pointer location
	on the board as we perform a pan / zoom. This is mostly relevant to
	panning and clipped zoom operations, as non-clipped zoom operations
	aim to leave the mouse pointer at the same PCB coordinate anyway.

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: polygon.c: Fix dicer to give up if the clipping
	region passed is invalid.  Most of the dance checking return codes from polyBoolean_free was
	unnecessary, as it sets the output to NULL if there is a problem, so
	remove that. Whilst we're at it, fix up some variable names to make
	the operation of the function clearer.

2011-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: polygon.c: Make RectPoly return NULL for zero or
	negatively sized rectangles Previously we would hit an assertion failure, where we could
	indicate the problem by returning NULL.  I've hit an issue in which some expose events in the GTK (+GL) HID
	are collapsing to a zero-width region on the PCB, and some code is
	tripping up on the bad clip polygon produced using RectPoly on the
	coordinates.  This causes segfaults in the branch which contains
	code to clip rendering of the soldermask at the board outline.  We could (and perhaps should) test in the expose handler, but the
	failure mode here is not ideal. Since most builds of PCB run with
	asserts disabled, the asserts are not hit here and a bad polygon is
	silently gets created with no contours. This upsets the polygon
	algebra routines somewhat, but returning a NULL (empty) polygon
	would be fine.

2011-08-26   Andrew Poelstra * asp11 AT sfu dot ca *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: gtk:
	remove call to ghid_layer_buttons_color_update The call to ghid_layer_buttons_color_update() in config_read() is
	now unnecessary; the Gtk layer selection widget does not exist, nor
	do the PCB struct's colors need to be synced with the ones in the
	Settings struct.  So this call makes no sense. Oh, and it causes a segfault.  Also: remove color-changing debug code from gui-top-window.c

	It is a unit suffix string denoting the unit setting used by pcb
	when loading the file.  Note the namespacing: as Attributes are persistent across
	file-saves, other programs may use them in future for purposes
	unknown and irrelevant to pcb. Therefore we will put all pcb
	attributes under the PCB namespace.  If this attribute is missing or invalid (i.e., the unit given is
	unsupported by pcb-printf), PCB will then use the --grid-units
	command-line option. Failing that, it will use the grid-units entry
	in ~/.pcb/preferences. Failing that, it will use mils.  Fixes-bug: lp-811393

	* src/pcb-printf.c: Modify get_unit_struct()'s bad-unit forgiveness Suffixes passed to get_unit_struct() may now start or end with
	whitespace, without affecting the result. However, incomplete units
	will NOT be matched.  This means that "mi" will no longer return the "mil" struct, for
	example.  The reasons for this change are:   1. The old behavior returned the first potential match,      regardless of other matches: "c" is always "cm", never      "cmil".    2. Prevent surprises (due to point #1, or typos).    3. Prevent user dependence on behavior that will change      as units are added or removed.  It still supports plural units, like "inches" or "mils".  However,
	it will read "miles" as "mil" because of this. ;)

2011-08-05   Andrew Poelstra * asp11 AT sfu dot ca *

	* src/main.c, src/pcb-printf.c, src/pcb-printf.h: Add alias support,
	get_unit_list() to pcb-printf Add pcb-printf support for unit aliases (just one per unit for now,
	we will fix this if the need arises). Map "inch" to "in" and "pcb"
	to "cmil" for backward compatibility.  Move initialize_units() call to main.c to ensure it is called before
	any other unit-handling code.  Also, add the functions   get_unit_list ();   get_n_units (); which do exactly what they look like. These will
	be used to build HID-export unit selectors.

	changed file.c to use this. The reason is that the %mc spec (cmils,
	no suffix) is locale- dependent, while %mr is not.  When we change the actual file format, file.c can be left alone and
	the relevant changes should be done to the %mr spec in pcb-printf.

	src/pcb-menu.res.in, src/pcb-printf.h, src/report.c: Remove mm/mil
	dichotomy, support arbitrary user units Currently, pcb assumes the user's display units are either mm or
	mil, and uses the Settings.grid_unit_mm boolean (and flag
	"grid_unit_mm") to determine which is which.  This patch removes the boolean and replaces it with the new
	Settings.grid_unit, which can be set to any unit supported by
	pcb-printf. The user-visible interface has not changed (there is
	still a mm/mil toggle in Gtk and the menus only contain mm and mil
	units), but new units can be accessed though the :SetUnits command.  The flag is still there and can be used in pcb-menu.res as usual.
	However, the new flag "grid_unit_mil" should be checked to see if
	mils are selected, since this is no longer implied by grid_unit_mm
	== 0.  There will be some user-visible changes to the precision of
	displayed values, since I have removed a lot of special-case code
	for this sort of this thing and use the default_prec of applicable
	units instead.  Because of the new flexibility, some idioms have been changed:   Settings.grid_unit_mm ? COORD_TO_MM (x) : COORD_TO_MIL (x) becomes   coord_to_unit (Settings.grid_unit, x)   Settings.grid_unit_mm ? "mm" : "mil" becomes   Settings.grid_unit->suffix   Settings.grid_unit_mm = 1; becomes   Settings.grid_unit = get_unit_struct ("mm"); For GUI use, the Unit structure returned by get_unit_struct exposes
	certain members:   suffix       : "mm"/"mil"/etc   in_suffix    : i18n version of the above   default_prec : precision used for spinboxes, labels, etc   step_tiny    :   step_small   :   step_medium  : step sizes for various spinboxes   step_large   :   step_huge    : Additionally, the *_increment_mm and *_increment_mil variables have
	their own structure containing default, min and max values.  These
	can no longer be set on the command line.

	suffixes like "inch" that we can read but never output.  The definitive unit lookup table should now be in pcb_printf.c. Any
	other tables used in the code should be merged into this.

	* src/action.c, src/create.c, src/create.h, src/file.c, src/main.c,
	src/parse_y.y: refdes labels in new layout can't be moved.  The .pcb file that gsch2pcb creates does not have a font in it.
	When loading files, the bounding box for all the text is calculated
	as the file is read.  In the case that there is no font, this is
	before the default font is installed, so the bounding box is way too
	small.  This patch remedies this by making all new PCB structures contain
	the default font by calling CreateDefaultFont in CreateNewPCB
	(CreateDefaultFont now takes in a PCBTypePtr instead of using the
	global PCB).  Previously, each time CreateNewPCB was called,
	CreateDefaultFont was called soon thereafter.  In the case of loading a PCB from a file.  The default font in the
	newly created struct PCB is marked invalid but not removed.  If the
	.pcb file contains a font, the default font will be overwritten by
	the file's font.  If it does not, PCB->Font will still be invalid
	after LoadPCB, a message is displayed that the default font is being
	used, and PCB->Font.Valid is set to true.  Also fixes a related bug where the memory for a symbols lines wasn't
	being cleared when a new file was brought into place.  Previously,
	this only happened if a new Font was loaded into an existing PCB.
	Now the font will be replaced every time a file with symbol
	information is loaded.  Rebased to actual git-head by Felix Ruoff Closes-bug: lp-699478

	main event loop for its timing. Each time a node was selected in the

	loops never became idle. Segfaults ensued quite readily, presumably
	due to the code not being designed to be reentrant.  It appears from reading the code, that these:   while (gtk_events_pending ())        /* Make sure everything gets

2011-07-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: hid/gtk: Fixup Zoom() and zoom_by() so
	they don't ignore passed coordinates.  The Zoom() action was passing bogus coordinates (in pixels), and
	zoom_by() was ignoring the passed coordinates and just using the
	mouse pointer location last recorded in gport->pcb_x and
	gport->pcb_y.  Fix zoom_by() to use the passed coordinates, fix Zoom() to not
	mangle the passed board coordinates into screen space.. zoom_by()
	wants board coords.  Finally, remove a special case from the Zoom() action where if the
	passed coordinates were both zero, we would pass the PCB coordinates
	of the board center. I'm hopeful that things will "just work"
	without this.

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Introduce a zoom_fit() function, remove
	duplicated code.  Several places in the code invoke a "zoom_fit" type function by
	calling zoom_to() or ghid_port_ranges_zoom() with bogus parameters.  Implement a specific function which restricts this to one location,
	then remove the now redundant ghid_port_ranges_zoom(), which
	basically just duplicated the code from zoom_by() with an added
	check for a 0.0 zoom factor to trigger the zoom-to-fit feature.

	system, where the coordinates (in PCB base units) represent that of
	an unflipped board, store them such that they are directly
	meaningful on the board.  As they now directly represent the cursor coordinats on the actual
	board, they don't require passing through the SIDE_{X,Y} macros
	before use with APIs that expect board coordinates.  To avoid confusion, view_x and view_y have been renamed to pcb_x and
	pcb_y to reflect the change of semantics.  In a number of cases, SIDE_{X,Y} macro calls were added to preserve
	correct functionality of old code which manipulates the mouse
	position in "view" coordinates. These are primarily concerned with
	zooming and panning.  Also rename the confusingly titled VIEW_{X,Y} macros to
	EVENT_TO_PCB_{X,Y}

	* src/crosshair.c: Try snapping to element marks first, as they are

	snapped to in preference to the nearest grid-point, then the element
	mark is tested and snapped to because it is closer than the pad.
	This can occur even when there is a closer grid point than the
	element mark, since the grid snap (nearest_is_grid == true) has
	already been discarded by the snap to the pad.

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Clean up coords_to_widget() in
	lesstif/main.c The coords_to_widget() function is used in exactly two places, for
	different purposes. To differentiate between the two uses, the
	``state'' parameter is set to -1.  The parameter is confusing enough without overloading it in this
	way.  Therefore I have split the function into two:   mark_delta_to_widget   cursor_pos_to_widget Further, I have converted the code inside the functions to use
	g_printf_strdup instead of a fixed buffer. The functions should both
	be easier to read now than the original.  There is one small change to user-visible output, which I think is
	justified: if you have a very small metric grid (<= 5um), the
	mark_delta output now uses .3f for both cartesian  and radial
	display. Before it would use .3f for cartesian, .2f for radial.

	* src/hid/ps/eps.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c: Convert ps/eps/lpr HID's to use
	pcb-printf The postscript HID now uses pcb-printf to output all units as inches
	rather than cmils; therefore the default scale is now 1:1 rather
	than 1:10000.  Therefore there will be a change in raw ps output but
	not in printed output.  As inches are output with 5 digits after the decimal point, there
	will be no loss in precision, though in future this will be easy to
	increase.  Also, minor code cleanups in ps.c to reduce global state and make
	global variables more visible.

	* src/djopt.c: Convert djopt.c to use pcb-printf No change in user-visible output.  Debug output is slightly changed since pcb-printf likes to put

	* src/report.c: Change report.c to use pcb-printf Right now there should be no change in the output from report.c;
	this is essentially just a code cleanup. The prec/UNIT nastiness is
	cleaned up -- precision is handled by the defaults in pcb-printf (.2
	for mil, .4 for mm, same as before) and unit selection is done with
	the %m+ specifier.  It's easy now to expand to allow auto-scaling or even automatic
	selection of metric/imperial based on sig.  figs., but I've played
	around with this and it looks like mixing units is confusing and
	hard-to-read, so we're sticking with just one of mm/mil for now.

	* src/pcb-printf.c, src/pcb-printf.h: Add %m+ specifier to

	cannot reliably count significant figures for many values. The
	result, for example, in report.c, is inconsistent and confusing
	dialogs with a mix of metric and imperial measurements.  The %m+ specifier is used to force pcb-printf to only use certain
	units; in this case, the user's gui setting of metric/imperial.

	the line ``f = NULL'' effectively a no-op.  However, the global variable f does need to be set to NULL for the
	code to recognize that the file is closed; otherwise it tries to
	keep using the (now invalid) file handle, causing crashes whenever
	the gerber HID is used more than once.  This is now done after every call to maybe_close_f(), rather than
	depending on the function itself to have side effects.

	* globalconst.h, src/buffer.c, src/global.h, src/parse_y.y: Fix
	shift/reduce conflicts Closes-bug: lp-794743 I moved the interpretation of what "measurement" means even further
	up the heirarchy, by storing the original integer part as well as
	the units in a structure, and applying the new/old/unitless meanings
	where they're used.  This way, there's no conflicts between a number
	which is a measurement, and a number which is a flag or mask, for
	the old formats that differ only in the number of parameters.  I also cleaned up the parser rules for "zero or more" type lists, to
	remove most of the remaining conflicts.  There's still one at the
	toplevel because we try to parse different types of files with the
	same parser.  Lastly, the symbol rules were combined into a "symbol head" rule
	with a common "symbol body" rule.  As a side effect, we can now reliably use units on old-style formats
	again, since the *100 scale factor is only applied if the units are
	not specified.

	* src/autoroute.c, src/macro.h: Remove memory allocation from

	the looping macros to allocate copies of the list in order to avoid

	iteration.  However, this caused memory leaks whenever there was an early return
	from the middle of the list. Bug lp-792139 shows pcb using over 2Gb
	of memory and crashing when optimizing rats on a large board.  This patch saves the next pointer before the loop body, rather than
	allocating a whole new list, to handle element deletions.  Closes-bug: lp-792139

	* src/file.h, src/parse_l.l, src/parse_y.y: Add support for reading
	unit suffixes in parser Bumped PCB_FILE_VERSION up to 20110703.  Removed old unit-reading code from parse_l.l since it was missing
	several units that we plan to support, and the scaling was backward
	for non-base units.  Also, we now read all numbers as doubles, except those that need
	integers (array indices and flags, mainly).  All measurements are
	round()ed to ints, after scaling, since that's what BDimension is
	and we don't want anomalies.  The old NUMBER and FLOAT terminals in parse_y have been replaced by:   1. INTEGER   - an integer, unscaled   2. number    - floating or integer, unscaled   3. measure   - a (possibly suffixed) measurement, with                  non-suffixed measurements read in cmils   4. oldmeasue - non-suffixed measurement, read in mils One exception is the PolyArea[] field. This is still read in cmil^2
	until we figure out what to do with it.  This way the parser works independently of PCB's internal base
	units, and supports umil, cmil, mil, in, nm, um, mm, m and km unit
	suffixes. The parsing code should also be clearer now since not
	everything is NUMBER, with scale factors handled after-the-fact with
	/100's or in the lexer.  Additionally, we now allow floating-point values for all
	measurements (even old-style mil fields), and pcb will allow spaces
	between measurements and their suffixes.  Actually using these
	``features'' will probably break tools that read .pcb files, though.

	1 4. Switch on stencil test (== 0), turn on updates to colour buffer 5. Paint outer polygon through areas of the stencil buffer still 0 6. Clear stencil buffer, switch off stencilling.  Caveat: This function might throw up if it is used whilst drawing the mask,
	since that uses stenciling as well. We don't use polygons on the
	mask, so its not a a problem. (Mask cutouts for octagonal pins do
	work correctly).

	(1) call only has any effect if the crosshair was notionally off
	before hand.  As a quick work-around (you could probably do it with less flicker
	with a little more logic), ensure the crosshair is turned off just
	prior to redrawing the screen - so it will switch back on correctly

	iterated over, this patch makes the relevant *_LOOP macros iterate

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/hidnogui.c: Add HID apis to handle live
	debug drawing from the core It is envisaved that this API should ONLY be used for debugging, not
	presenting a user-interface. In general, the GUIs may have their own
	special requirements for drawing the board, and this API is not
	meant to allow the core to augment or present user-visible drawing.
	This is reflected in the API naming.  Request permission for debug drawing HID *ddraw = gui->request_debug_draw (void); Returns a HID pointer which should be used rather than the global
	gui-> for making drawing calls. If the return value is NULL, then
	permission has been denied, and the debug drawing must not continue.  Flush pending drawing to the screen void ddraw->flush_debug_draw (void); May be implemented as a NOOP if the GUI has chosen to send the debug
	drawing directly to the screen.  When finished, the user must inform the GUI to clean up resources: ddraw->finish_debug_draw (void); Any remaining rendering will be flushed to the screen.

	drawing APIs at any arbitrary point in time.  Expose some API from crosshair.c to perform the actual drawing on
	demand, and add hooks to the HID structure to notify the GUI when it
	would previously have called the crosshair or mark drawing routines.  This allows renderers with defined setup and tear-down requirements
	around drawing to execute them before the objects are drawn.  CrosshairOn() and CrosshairOff() now simply set the Crosshair.On
	flag and call the appropriate notification hooks.  This commit replaces all HideCrosshair() and RestoreCrosshair()

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Fix damage area computation We should reset the left and top bounds to MAXINT, and the right and
	bottom bounds to -MAXINT. This way the correct bounds are computed
	when gathering.  The code previously every coordinate to 0, meaning that the box
	encompasing (0, 0)  up to the (max_x, max_y) would be invalidated,
	rather than (min_x, min_y) to (max_x, max_y).  No improvement is going to be seen, as both the GTK and Lesstif GUIs
	ignore the damaged bounds and repaint the whole screen each time -
	it is just for correctness.

	* src/crosshair.c, src/crosshair.h, src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Don't
	abuse CrosshairOn() API to force a redraw.  Expose DrawAttached() to the HIDs so they can call it themselves,
	and don't have to cheat by forcing Crosshair.On to false.  Make DrawAttached() and DrawMark() a NOP if the relevant item is not
	being shown. Ie. if !Crosshair.On, both functions draw nothing. If
	!Marked.status, DrawMark() draws nothing.  A minor change is required in CrosshairOff() to XOR un-draw before
	switching the flag to off.  Not known to fix any particular bug, but it is possible that the
	crosshair should not be drawn at a given point (due to changes
	taking place inside a HideCrosshair() / RestoreCrosshair() pair.  Tested with Lesstif and GTK HIDs.

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: hid/gerber: Remove option for thickness
	of auto-generated outline layer We don't mess with the thickness of the user's hand-drawn outline,
	and this option implies that we do. I cannot think of a sensible way
	to present the option without confusing the user, so lets remove it.  Whilst the previous default of 10 mil was fine, 8 mil matches the
	width used on the fab drawing, so I have changed to that value.

	extents.  2. You may pan the board so that edges need not be on the edge of
	the window, such as centering an edge for inspection.  Note that the smallest the board can be is 1/10th the window size.
	While this is arbitrary, it's easily changed if needed, and avoids
	problems with miniscule boards (and thus maxiscule coordinate
	systems).  The 'v' key still zooms the board to fit, but now centers the board
	in the window rather than placing it at the upper left.

	from netlist window We weren't updating the pointer location after having panned the
	connection into the center of the screen.  Also fixes the open-coded panning code to work for flipped views.
	The patch is pretty horrible at best, but appears to fix the issue.  Unfortunately the locical call to use (the "Center" action) cannot
	be made through the generic action code as we need to specify the
	location explicitly. We could perhaps export the Centre action
	function, or refactor it as a wrapper around a helper function which
	we would then export and call.  I aim to eventually rework the GTK HID's coordinate transforms
	(including flipped views), event handling, view panning and pointer
	warping in order to give greater sepeatation between the renderer
	agnostic parts of the HID and the renderer. This will be needed for
	the 3D portions of the PCB+GL branch.  It seems most sensible to start refactoring from a state where the
	existing code at least functions correctly (even if it isn't
	pretty), rather than work in fixes as I refactor.

	* src/find.c, src/find.h, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c,

	changes relating to RatFindHook calls This reverts commit 1aac06b665330507ca42f380e38f32875a979cd9          and commit d3b508ca272b7d89aa27f552ab78943f9bed27f9.  I made a mistake by assuming the undo data saved by the RatFindHook
	(when looking up nets to select) was redundant. I had presumed this
	since the flags being set are reset again before we finish
	processing.  What actually happens, is that further processing sets the SELECTED
	flag on the FOUND objects. Undo data is saved for the SELECTED flag
	addition, which stores the previous flags of the object. When an
	undo is performed, it also restores the FOUND flag we wanted to keep
	unset.  In order to get back to our original state, we need the RatFindHook
	to store undo information for when the FOUND flag was initially set.  The ResetConnections() call after the RatFindHook should still be ok
	not saving undo information, as it only touches object flags which
	will be restored anyway by the undo data now saved by the
	RatFindHook.  NB: Revert was manually modified to retain an indenting change in
	find.c and to add the required changes to select.c, which had
	additions using the RatFindHook API since the above reverted commits
	were made.

	undo handling for ResetFound*() and ResetConnections() Many callers have this idiom:   SaveUndoSerialNumber ();   ResetFoundPinsViasAndPads (AndDraw);   RestoreUndoSerialNumber ();   ResetFoundLinesAndPolygons (AndDraw); The intent is to squash the two operations into one undo operation.
	The ResetFound* functions DO increment the Undo serial number but
	ONLY if that particular function makes a change.  Assume for the example that the first ResetFound* call makes some
	change and increments the serial number. This is then reset by the
	caller. If the second ResetFound* call doesn't find anything, there
	is no overall increment to the serial number.  Move the undo serial number handling out of the ResetFound* calls,
	and let the callers increment the serial number if desired. To
	facilitate this, return a boolean value from these functions to
	indicate whether any changes were made which could be undone.  For convenience, expose previously static find.c function
	ResetConnections() in order to avoid repeating Undo handling in each
	caller to the two ResetFound* functions which are often called
	together.

	not.  3. DO NOT strcpy a the default string...     we don't know if it will overflow our buffer 4. For the "fileselect" case, return NULL if the user didn't give us
	   a filename, and the caller didn't specify a default string. Prompt

	* src/polygon1.c: Various speedups to the polygon code.  Attempt to fix polygon slowness by avoiding the need to create a
	completely new polygon for each boolean operation. This mostly
	relies upon r-tree searches to find contours to operate on - rather
	than searching each in turn.  We avoid labelling all of the "A" polygon's contours, use the
	contour r-trees to dynamically search the required data.  Added code to reparent holes which end up in the wrong polygon piece
	after inserting a new hole in InsertHoles. This means we don't have
	to dump every potental hole we encounter in the holes insersion
	queue, hopefully leading to better dynamic update performance.  At this point, polygon performance has finally seen a net gain.  HOWEVER: Due to differences in the order of polygon operations, the          data-structures resulting from a boolean polygon operation          may be sorted differently.           In certain contrived cases, where a polygon is clipped into          identically sized pieces, the resulting piece of polygon          which PCB will keep and use on the board is different after          this commit.

	* src/polyarea.h, src/polygon.c, src/polygon1.c: Optimise polygon

	there is a significant overall slow-down at this point in the patch
	series.

	* src/polygon1.c: Use rtree of countours when computing an

	      continually, so it doesn't need to be recreated with each call
	to intersect().

2010-11-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: polygon.c: Accumulate vias and lines into batches
	before subtracting them Accumulate polygons to clear from lines and pins in batches, then
	clear from the polygon. Not quite sure why, but this _really_ seems
	to speed up loading very complex boards. (e.g. 50sec -> 10sec for
	one example).  Possibly this is because withing the assembled batches, it is
	cheaper to produce a more unified contour (touching lines), and the
	complex contours of the main polygon are broken less frequently.  It isn't quite clear why this helps so much for pins / vias (which
	won't usually touch each-other), however it changes a 50sec load
	time to 10 sec.  This could perhaps be because any contours which
	are smashed by clearance of closely spaced vias / pins now only
	incurr the penalty of breaking the main contour once every batch
	(100 vias / pins).  Batch sizes (20 for lines, 100 for pins / vias) aren't necessarily
	optimal! Also, clear pins and vias last...  There is a chance these objects are simpler, and just end up as
	holes in the main polygon, rather than causing a contour
	intersection. This means it is cheaper to add them last.  If we add them first, and make the polygon complex, objects (usually
	lines) which pierce the polygon's outer contour cause all the holes
	to be removed and queued for re-insersion after the new contour is
	constructed.

	brought in by half a pixel to ensure it's drawn in the resulting

	Split usage of "max_layer" into max_copper_layer and max_group  PCB has an equal number of layer groups as copper layers, so the
	"max_layer" #define'd variable has been used throught the codebase
	to delimit iteration over both layer groups, and layers.  This makes it hard for people reading the codebase to identify
	whether a given loop is over layers or layer groups (since the
	counter variable is often fairly terse or indescript). Confusingly,
	in some of the code, layer groups indexes are stored in a variable
	called "layer".  To aid understanding of the code, this commit removes the max_layer
	variable (#define'd to (PCB->Data->LayerN)), and replaces it with
	two similarly #define'd variables, "max_copper_layer" and
	"max_group".  This commit also introduces convenience macros:   #define solder_silk_layer (max_copper_layer + SOLDER_LAYER)   #define component_silk_layer (max_copper_layer + COMPONENT_LAYER) Which make the code intention much clearer for a common case of the
	old max_layer variable usage.

	* src/action.c: Add new-part-location to import Adds import::newX, import::newY, and import::disperse attributes.
	These determine where new parts are located when they're added to
	the layout, including some random variation to keep them from being
	all on exactly the same spot.  Parameters were added to Import() to
	set these:  In @code{Import()} is called with @code{setnewpoint} then the
	location of new components can be specified.  This is where parts
	show up when they're added to the board.  The default is the center
	of the board.   @table @code  @item Import(setnewpoint) Prompts the user to click on the board somewhere, uses that point.
	If called by a hotkey, uses the current location of the crosshair.   @item Import(setnewpoint,mark) Uses the location of the mark.  If no mark is present, the point is
	not changed.   @item Import(setnewpoint,center) Resets the point to the center of the board.   @item Import(setnewpoint,X,Y,units) Sets the point to the specific coordinates given.  Example:
	  @code{Import(setnewpoint,50,25,mm)}  @end table Note that the X and Y locations are stored in attributes named
	  @code{import::newX} and @code{import::newY} so you could change
	 them manually if you wished.   Calling @code{Import(setdisperse,D,units)} sets how much the newly
	placed elements are dispersed relative to the set point.  For
	example,  @code{Import(setdisperse,10,mm)} will offset each part
	randomly up to 10mm away from the point.  The default dispersion is
	1/10th of the smallest board dimension.  Dispersion is saved in the
	  @code{import::disperse} attribute.

	polygon drawing tool, with the hole ending when the start point is
	re-clicked.  To avoid creating illegal polygons, the hole drawn is subtracted
	from a representation of the original polygon with the
	poly_Boolean_free().  This consolidates any contours it intersects
	with and prevents the user defining contours which intersect each
	other. (Although we don't currently prevent the the user drawing
	self-intersecting contours).  The resulting POLYAREA is re-processed into PolygonType objects,
	potentially more than one - if the hole drawn bisects the original
	polygon. To keep undo operations simple, these are added as
	completely new objects and the original polygon is deleted - along
	with its ID.

	Support holes in input polygons (incl. file-format addition) PCB file-format date is now 20100606, and files saved with this or
	greater PCB version will not load with older versions of PCB.  If a
	particular board doesn't make use of the polygon hole feature, the
	PCB revision date in the file can be manually reset to 20070407.  The file-format addition is as follows. Previously, a polygon would
	be specified as a series of coordinates, such as: Layer(1 "component") (   Polygon("clearpoly")   (     [6000 6000] [81000 6000] [81000 59000] [6000 59000]   ) ) This commit introduces the ability to specify negative contours
	which form holes in the polygon shape, e.g.: Layer(1 "component") (   Polygon("")   (     [6000 6000] [81000 6000] [81000 59000] [6000 59000]     Hole (       [76000 55000] [76000 38000] [58000 38000] [58000 55000]     )     Hole (       [10000 10000] [10000 28000] [27000 28000] [27000 10000]     )   ) ) The winding order of the contours specified in the file does not
	matter, since PCB will automatically invert the order of the points
	as necessary (as it always did with the outer contour).  Hole contours should not intersect or self-intersect (although this
	isn't checked for at load time). Hole contours must not intersect
	the polygon's outer contour.  Technical details: The PolygonType structure has a number of new fields, the critical
	ones being an array of indices defining the start of hole contours.  (PolygonType *)->HoleIndex[n] The number of hole contours is stored in (PolygonType
	*)->HoleIndexN, and the maximum allocated memory for indices in
	(...)->HoleIndexMax.  The first hole contour starts at the point
	given by (...)->Points[(...)->HoleIndex[0]], and continues until the start of
	the next contour, or the last point defined.  By storing all polygon points (including holes) in the existing
	array (...)->Points[], existing code which operates on the polygon as a
	whole, e.g. translation and rotation, can operate without change.  For other operations, determining wrap-around to operate within the
	same contour requires more computation. Some helper functions have
	been introduced in polygon.c to aid this, next_contour_point() and
	prev_contour_point(). Where applicable, these have been used to
	simplify existing code which used ad-hoc wrap-around code.  polygon_point_idx() computes the array index of a point in a polygon
	from its PointTypePtr address. This is used to replace a search
	idiom used in a number of places. polygon_point_contour() returns
	the number of the contour a given point index belongs in, 0 for the
	outer contour, 1 for the first hole etc..  Undo: Undo with holes has become a little more complex. The undo for a
	point removal must now record which contour the point came from.
	This is determined by the index of the removed point, and a new
	boolean flag "last_in_contour", indicating if the point was at the
	end of its contour.  This flag is passed to InsertPointIntoObject(),
	which uses it to disambiguate inserting a point at an index on the
	boundary of two contours.  Undo operations for removing hole contours "cheat" by saving a copy
	of the whole polygon into the undo buffer rather than attempting to
	describe the operation as a delta change to an existing polygon.
	When undoing, the object IDs are swapped to keep them consistent.

2010-06-02   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix poly_ComputeInteriorPoint() to work correctly
	for holes The step where the algorithm finds a convex node to start from must
	take into account whether the polygon vertices are ordered as a hole
	or an outer contour. We now correctly compute a point inside the
	hole, rather than possibly outside it.  This fixes an assertion on the following test-case. Prior to this
	commit, the incorrect "interior" point tested for the concave hole
	happens to lie inside the polygon's other hole, causing it to fail
	an assert during processing.  Layer(2 "solder") (   Line[340000 160000 183700 108000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Line[92000 121000 120000 90000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Line[270000 90000 120000 90000 1500 3000 "clearline"]   Polygon("clearpoly")   (     [40000 40000] [320000 40000] [320000 200000] [40000 200000]   ) ) The bug was created in my attempt to speed up poly_ContourInContour:

2010-05-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Speed up poly_ContourInContour() test by computing
	interior point NB: This introduces a behaviour change in the boundary case, that
	two identical contours will now be considered to be inside each
	other.  First perform a test on an arbitrary boundary node (proving that the
	contour being testing for "insideness" is not outside the other
	contour. (This cannot not conclusively prove the contour is inside).  In many cases, this simple node test gives enough evidence to return
	0 for the ContourInContour test computing and testing an interior
	point.  Rather than checking each exterior point, compute a strictly
	interior point (not on the boundary), and test that against the
	second contour.  Benchmarked to improve performance over other fixes for the buggy
	test.  Example board load (CPU) times for a complex board:   21.50 (buggy contour_in_contour - single node point test)   24.43 (brute-force node point tests)   21.79 (single node test, then internal point test)

2010-05-10   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix poly_ContourInContour() test not to return
	TRUE for touching contours This test could previously return true for touching contours, such
	 as: __________....  |_________ |  : :........ ||  : ::  /\  : ||  :
	Note that the bounding box of A is inside that of B, :: /  \ :/  \ :
	such that initial bounding box checks won't reject the ::/ A  \/  B
	\:   possibility of A being inside B.  ::\    /\    /: :: \  / :\  /
	: ::..\/..:.\/..: When testing for insideness, the first point on A's contour is
	picked.  In this case, unfortunately being the touching X point
	between the two contours. This point (correctly) returns as being
	inside B - and the false presumption is that the whole A contour is
	inside B.  This commit introduces an unfortunately slow, but more robust test,
	where we check each node in A for whether it is inside B. We return
	as soon as we find an A node outside B, however this means the test
	is VERY much slower for the case where A _is_ inside B.

	* src/polygon1.c: Add comment explaining assumptions for

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick
	Bernaud: Add function to register single action.  The possibility to register a single action has been introduced with
	commit 337fa8ba8094cee1ed291cec7bf29895ac7c9d72 but then reverted
	later when changing way of passing context to action callback.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Modify
	HID actions storage.  It removes the HID_ActionNode structure and directly store
	registered actions in an array of HID_Action*.  It also provides a nicer way of making sure the array is sorted and
	the code for binary search within the array has been removed in
	favor of a call to bsearch().

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Set 'exporter'
	global variable before printing defaults.  In print_defaults(), when the HID to print defaults is not a gui,
	set 'exporter' global variable prior to calling HID's
	get_export_options() callback.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/main.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Rewrite function
	that print HID options.  The previous version of usage_hid() had a strange search for gui HID
	attributes through 'hid_attr_node' rather than requesting them
	directly from the HID.  As a result it was calling the get_export_options() callback on
	exporter without prior setting of the exporter global variable.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:
	gtkhid: Avoid use of 'exporter' when testing for exporter
	availability.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:
	gtkhid: Set and unset global variable 'exporter' when printing.  The GTK hid was not setting the global variable 'exporter' before
	exporting the layout in ghid_dialog_print(): exporter HID relying on
	this variable being set were lost.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Apply
	patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Provide context to callbacks of actions
	through global variable.  Providing a context to action is necessary for scripting languages
	(for example). To do so, a global variable ('current_action') is
	being defined: it is saved, set and restored when running the
	callback of an action in a way similar to what PCB already does with
	HIDs.  The callback function may access the action it belongs to and cast
	it the way it wants to extract information from a potentially
	extended HID_Action structure.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Sort
	actions by references in 'all_actions'.  Previously, when building 'all_actions', a copy of every HID_Action
	was performed for each action. Now it builds 'all_actions' with
	pointers to the actual HID_Action structures (without reallocating).

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/hidint.h,
	src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Revert
	"single-action register/deregister".  This reverts commits 337fa8ba8094cee1ed291cec7bf29895ac7c9d72 and
	b274cf8fe9c8caf5bcd4edc28935c88cf5bab7f4 before the introduction of
	a new context passing scheme for actions.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid.h: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:  Fix comment for
	global variable 'gui' in hid.h.  hid_start_gui() does not exist. The variable is instead set in
	main() and hid_expose_callback().

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/draw.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud: Modify
	DrawSpecialPolygon() prototype to not take a pointer on HID.  DrawSpecialPolygon() was the only function to take a HID as
	parameter.  Every other draw function works on the current HID
	through global variable 'gui'.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud:
	Support HID_Mixed options in attribute dialog Since an HID_Mixed attribute is the combination of a real and an
	enum, reuse the code for HID_Enum to provide a combo box next to the
	spin button for the real part.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c: 
	Apply patch from Patrick Bernaud.  Modified code to not abort on HID_Mixed attributes. Th gtk HID is
	modified to understand such an attribute (though the attribute
	dialog has still no support for them), the lesstif HID is unchanged.

2010-03-14   Stuart Brorson * sdb AT cloud9 dot net *

	* src/main.c: Applying patch from Patrick Bernaud.  HIDs with a name too long were breaking alignement in usage() as the
	code requested insertion of a tab after the name even for HID names
	already exceeding the length of the tabulation.  This is similar to how usage_attr() already does alignment of name
	and help text.

2010-03-11   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/main.c, src/misc.c: Remove Settings.init_done
	variable and its usage This variable was previously used to allow action scripts run prior
	to loading the GUI to avoid GUI startup if they executed a "Quit"
	action.  The requirement dates back prior to the HID split, where the "Quit"
	action would cause PCB to call gtk_main_quit(), an operation which
	is illegal if the GUI main loop was not yet started. The init_done
	flag was used in QuitApplication(), both to determine whether the
	GUI had started, and if not - to note that the GUI should not be
	initialised later. (Instead of calling gtk_main_quit()).  With the HID split, the QuitApplication() function was changed to
	call exit(0) rather than gtk_main_quit(), so this dance isn't
	necessary at all now.. in either case, we can just exit the
	application immediately.

	* data/pcb.desktop.in: Revert "As silly as it seems to group any

	deliberately omit the Education category.. this is not where we need
	to fix this issue.  I strongly object to putting bogus categories into our apps.  If

	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: hid/gtk: Prevent extra windows from showing
	unnecessarily Prevent the library, log, and netlist windows in the GTK HID from
	being shown unless explicitely requested.  This is done by splitting
	ghid_*_window_show into ghid_*_window_create, which creates all the
	resources for the window, and ghid_*_window_show, which actually
	shows the window (and optionally "presents" it, which pulls it to
	the foreground and gives it focus).  Since the NetlistShow action no longer actually shows the netlist
	window, but sets the node/net that is shown in the window (if and
	when it is visible), this patch also adds NetlistPresent which
	presents the netlist window.  This can be added to the
	FindConnections menu item to restore the behavior of bringing up the
	netlist window on a find.  Added an action LogShowOnAppend() which can restore the old behavior
	that the log window is shown whenever something is appended to it
	(currently off by default).

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh: Add some quoting to handle the case where
	there are spaces in some of the directory names.  As noted by peque on irc, this script failed when the build
	directory was located somewhere that had a space in a directory
	name.  Adding the extra quotes fixes that.

	* src/find.c, src/search.c: Fix bugs in the arc intersection
	routine. Bug #2942582 This bug resulted in various false identificaton of connectivity
	between arcs and other object. Notes from Ineiev's emails: So I built a montecarlo; fixed some ugly unrealistic cases like thin
	arc merged in bloat and arc->Delta<-360; ran the test program
	(aat.c) several hours on different machins; that discovered no
	errors, though the number of points was not very high (a thousand or
	slightly more): the reference functions are really slow.  That resulted in arc.bis.patch. I tested it also with already
	mentioned teardropped OSDCU.pcb and t1.pcb. Then, eliminate two
	precision losses.  I feel I ought to stop here: the patch fixes many more bugs than
	originally reported.

	* src/crosshair.c: By popular(*) request, Make the cross-hair snap
	to the center of pads * Popular.. or vocal?, I'm not sure.  If more people don't like the new behaviour, there is always git
	revert.  There was of course, a third possibility - adding support to snap to
	pad end-points _and_ their centers. I rejected this because of
	"nearly" square pads - it becomes difficult to know if you've picked
	up the center of the pad, and many of those asking for
	snap-to-center wanted it in order to pick up and align components by
	their pads.  NB: Optimised rat-lines still go to the edge of pads, as this can
	    often look less cluttered. Rat-lines drawn to the center of a pad
	    will work correctly, and remain on the pad center until the next
	    time "optimise" is run on the rats-nest.

2009-11-15   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/find.c, src/rubberband.c: Add support for rat-lines ending at

	center of a pad.

	* src/draw.h: draw.h: Remove ClearPin prototype missed in last

2009-11-14   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Don't clear pins / vias from polygons... it is
	already done! Our polygons already the required holes for pins, vias, pads etc..
	so don't waste drawing clearances twice. This looks to be a legacy
	from the way PCB used to draw polygons.

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c, src/polyarea.h, src/polygon.c,
	src/polygon1.c: polygons: Tag circular contours so they can be
	special-cased when drawing.  Tagging circular contours allows GUIs (if they wish) to draw
	circular holes in polygons more accurately, and potentially faster -
	depending on whether they use mask based rendering or rely on the
	dicer.  When zoomed far out (and using a mask based scheme), the drawing
	routine can use a lower vertex count approximation to the contour -
	leading to rendering speed improvements. This is used to reasonable
	effect in the experimental OpenGL branch.  Modify hid/common/draw_helpers.c to use these tags when thin-drawing
	polygon contours with common_thindraw_pcb_polygon(). This allows the
	GUI to change the level of detail rendered with zoom, and serves to
	test this feature.  DRC checking and output are still done using the fixed resolution
	approximation present in the polygon contour, so in this respect -
	it makes rendering somewhat unfaithful to the final output.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: draw.c: Draw all vias, pins and pads under the mask
	layer This fixes an issue where the rendering of a partially masked via is
	inaccurate. The down-side is that partially, or completely masked
	vias become obscured by the mask drawn above them.  If the user is previewing the mask rendering, it is probably best
	that they see an accurate representation - even if this means hiding
	vias.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Fix thindraw mask drawing for pins, including
	octagonal ones We need to set the line-width for round pins when in thin-draw and
	clearing the mask.  We need to tell DrawSpecialPolygon() whether we need thin-draw or
	not depending on whether we're clearing the mask or not. We don't
	need to set the line-width outside of DrawSpecialPolygon(), since it
	sets it its-self.  Fix DrawSpecialPolygon() to set the line width and cap style on the
	correct GC.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Control update of
	NoHoles cache based on clip region If at least 50% of the bounding box of a polygon is within the clip
	region, compute the whole NoHoles polygon and cache it for later
	rendering.  If less of the polygon is within the clip region, just compute what
	we need to draw the piece we've been asked for.

2009-11-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Fix memory leak in
	polygon NoHoles clipping routine poly_CopyContour creates the edge tree, as does ContourToPoly(),
	which overwrite the one created in poly_CopyContour().  Replace call to ContourToPoly() with a discrete alternative without
	the poly_PreContour() call.  Also, don't try to poly_Free() the output of poly_Boolean_free() in
	an error condition. poly_Boolean_free() re-uses the A input polygon
	for its output, so attempting to free that might be dangerous.  poly_Boolean_free() should free its inputs (and any partial output)
	if it encounters an error.

2009-11-12   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c: hid/common: Clip no-holes polygon
	pieces before calling fill_contour This avoids integer overflow in some HIDs (GTK, Lesstif?) when
	drawing at high zoom level. Such overflow would lead to incorrectly
	drawn polygons.  It is possible that a similar bug could effect thin-drawn polygons,
	but that has not manifested its-self so far. If we were to clip
	these in the future, we need to be careful to extend the clip region
	slightly off-screen, so the outlines are not drawn.  Ideally we would clip these vertices using a Sutherland-Hodgman
	clipping algorithm, then we could simply discard edges which are
	clipped completely.

	using strcmp() and strcasecmp() in different places. That commit
	changed to strcasecmp(). Lets choose to keep the more restrictive

	* src/polygon.c: polygon.c: Remove unused #define COARSE_CIRCLE 0

2009-11-12   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Speed up unsubtraction from polygons when objects
	are deleted This process worked by adding a new "blob" of polygon to cover in
	the hole made by the object being deleted. If this "blob"
	intersected the contour of the original polygon, it would cause the
	polygon's contour to be damaged. To avoid this, the unsubract code
	would always clip the resulting polygon against the original
	(pristine) polygon contour.  Unfortunately.. this clipping operation is gauranteed to intersect
	the contour of the polygon - a very expensive operation, since all
	holes inside the polygon (many on a complex board) have to be
	re-processed.  This speed-up is achieved by reversing the order of operation. The
	"blob" to be added to the polygon is first clipped against the
	pristine contour (a relatively cheap operation). This then allows us
	to add the new clipped blob to the more complex polygon on the board
	without worry that the contour may be compromised.

	* src/file.c: file.c: Add profiling of CPU seconds consumed during
	file load This information is useful to benchmark the load of complex boards
	which consume a lot of CPU cycles clipping polygons during loading.  Adding this upstream will allow me to gain information from users
	describing load slowness, without having a copy their design.

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: hid/ps: Don't use diced polygons for postscript
	output This speeds up postscript output on boards with complex polygons.  It has the added advantage for some postscript and pdf readers that
	there are no accidental gaps rendered between pieces of the diced
	polygon due to non-global anti-aliasing in their renderer.

	* src/polygon.c: Play with number of line segments in line caps By changing from 36 lines-segments per circle to 40, we create a

	match correct edge state The old code would mistakenly annotate with the edge state for the
	next edge. From polygon1.c: /* note that a vertex v's Flags.status represents the edge defined
	 by * v to v->next (i.e. the edge is forward of v)  */

2009-11-11   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: Re-write node_label() to only label the edge being
	passed as its argument.  Breifly, the old code tried to walk the entire CVCList labeling
	multiple edges. The new code tries only to label the argument vertex
	i.e. the forward ('N') edge from this vertex. It tries to look
	counter-clockwise just one edge which will give the answer in most
	cases. If that fails it looks further into the CVCList until it can
	find the answer, then stops. The code is much simpler because we
	know that the edge we are labeling is always departing the
	cross-vertex point.  (Futher comments and original bug diagnosis by Peter Clifton) This prevents "double labeling", where the old routine could label
	any edges which intersect at the vertex passed to node_label().  This fixes a bug discovered by Stefan Salewski, where certain boards
	could trigger an assert failure when PCB was built with debugging.  The bug, it would seem - is relating to the way (and order) we were
	labeling edges of polygon contours: 2 |/\     In this diagram, x is on the outer contour of our polygon,
	x  |    and is in fact two vertices at the same point, lets denote
	|\/     these as |\ and |/ 1 The labelling algorithm works up from point 1, gets to |\, whereupon
	it gets the CVCList for the spatial point x - which contains |\ AND
	|/ along with the (shared) edges from the clipping contour.  node_label is called with the |\ vertex, but in the process of
	scanning the CVCList at this point, it also checks for SHARED edges.
	It _only_ checks shared edges against the |\ vertex, NOT the |/ one.  During this pass, the | edge coming from the |/ vertex gets
	mis-labelled as "OUTSIDE", where is should eventually get labelled
	"SHARED" BUG: We then skip over calling node_label with the |/ vertex, since | has
	already been labelled. We next get to point 2.  Point 2 looks at the | edge, and declares it to be "INSIDE". (It
	should already have been labelled "SHARED" by this point, so
	node_label doesn't know any better.  The | edge is already labelled "OUTSIDE" when we go to label it
	"INSIDE".. assertion fail.  This commit avoids missing the correct labelling of shared edges, by
	ensuring we never label any edges in advance of calling node_label
	for them.

	 Install Readme.txt in @docdir@ Also removes unnecessary fiddling with pkgdatadir which was
	responsible for creating an empty directory $datadir/pcb-$VERSION/ Adjusted pcb.nsi.in to match new location of Readme.txt, but have

	* src/polygon.c: Pass r_NoHolesPolygonDicer a POLYAREA *, not a
	PLINE * No functional changes to callers of NoHolesPolygonDicer() The allows state in the POLYAREA to be passed into the recursive
	dicer. This is needed in order to maintain an up to date r-tree of
	contours in the POLYAREA.

2009-10-22   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix bug with polygon boolean operation PBO_XOR (I
	think!) If the contour in A is outside of B, it should be kept. It seems
	this case may have been missed.  PCB does not use the PBO_XOR operation, so it is difficult to test
	whether this is correct or not.

	* src/global.h, src/polyarea.h, src/polygon1.c: Make rtree_t type

2009-10-21   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix a bug in gtk hid which caused
	layer buttons to get confused (sourceforge bug 1988951) In ghid_layer_enable_buttons_update, the layer_buttons array was
	being indexed using a counter which stoped at the current max_layer,
	which was wrong.  Changed this to use the constants LAYER_BUTTON_*.  Also made the handling of the silk and rats buttons match the
	(slightly more correct) handling of the other buttons in
	layer_enable_button_cb.

	* src/create.c, src/global.h, src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c,
	src/mymem.c, src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Add cache for "noholes",
	diced versions of polygons

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/draw_helpers.c, src/polygon.c: Give callback from
	NoHolesPolygonDicer ownership of the returned contour This means callers of NoHolesPolygonDicer() should call
	poly_FreeContours on the contour they are passed (if they do not
	wish to retain it).

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polyarea.h, src/polygon1.c: Replace poly_Clear(POLYAREA *)
	function with poly_FreeContours(PLINE **) The poly_Clear function only clears the contours of the polygon
	anyway, so make a more explicitly named function to do this work,
	and pass the contours directly.  This will be useful should we want to deal with a series of contours
	separately from a POLYAREA object.

2009-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c, src/create.c, src/strflags.c: Fix "newfullpoly" flag
	test and save its state into the .pcb file.  The flag controlling this behaviour is kept up to date as a PCB
	flag, not something which is updated in Settings.FullPoly. Change
	the test accordingly.  Added a PCB flag "newfullpoly" to save this state in the .pcb file.  NOTE: "full" polygons severly break connectivity checking, as the
	      code always treats broken up pieces of the polygon as being
	connected.        It _might_ have been better to leave this support broken - so       users don't inadvertently create polygons with the "fullpoly"
	      flag.  TODO: Consider removing, hiding or adding warnings to this feature.

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: hid/common: Don't walk off end of string
	whilst parsing.  Fixed a bug where the action parser would walk off the end of a

2009-10-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/global.h, src/polygon1.c, src/rtree.c: Add some annotations to
	help optimise branch prediction.  Macros G_LIKELY and G_UNLIKELY were taken from GLib (LGPL 2), and
	renamed without the G_ prefix.  This hasn't had much discernable effect

2009-10-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Rework iteration over contours in "intersect" to
	improve performance We don't need to be using an r_tree search to determine if a
	contour's bounding box hits anything in another contour. Just
	compare the bounding boxes directly, then continue to the more
	expensive testing.  Rather than counting the vertices of each POLYAREA then swapping to
	ensure we loop over the the small one, wait until we've worked out
	which contours we're comparing. Rather than swapping, we just choose
	which to loop over. This saves us time in the case where the larger
	intersecting contour belongs to the polygon with fewer vertices.  In one case, this change reduced a complex board's load time from
	~140 seconds to ~70.

	* src/hid/common/actions.c: Allow quoted strings and escaped
	characters in action arguments.  Quoting works similar to bash quoting: A backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal
	value of the next character that follows.  To get a literal '\' use
	"\\".  Enclosing characters in single quotes preseves the literal value of
	each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur
	between single quotes, even when preceded by a blackslash.  Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of
	all characters within the quotes, with the exception of '\' which
	maintains its special meaning as an escape character.

	* src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Fix command line exporting.  Previously, hid_actionv was changed to always call gui->get_coords
	wether or not the action had a need_coord_msg, in an attempt to
	always get the latest coords for things like zoom or pan that didn't
	have a need_coord_msg.  However, this broke command line exporting
	because it was trying to call get_coords on the nogui hid.  Added the check back in to only call gui->get_coords when the action
	has a need_coord_msg and added need_coord_msg's to actions that need
	coords.

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Adding ability to customize mouse
	scroll action in GTK.  Changed the mouse_scroll gtk event handler to use do_mouse_action
	instead of manually handling the event.  gtk treats scrolling
	differently as a mouse button event, and doesn't give a mouse button
	number, so this patch just hard codes up/down/left/right to buttons
	4 through 7.  This corresponds to the default names used in the
	resource file, and, for X11, gtk hardcodes mouse buttons 4 - 7 to
	the scrolling events anyway.  This may cause problems in quartz or
	windows if some mouse has a bunch of buttons and quartz/windows maps
	those buttons to numbers 4 - 7, but I don't have a system to test
	that (and in that case the names in the resource file would be wrong
	as well).  Added a Scroll action to the gtk hid to be able to mimic the
	existing scroll wheel behavior with an action script.

	click.  so when drawing a line that you want to force a DRC
	"Violation" and you need to use the control key, it will cancel the
	line being drawn, and start a new point.  This is tested in the lesstif and GTK hids, under OSX wher ehte
	option key is the "alt" key.   I leave it to the patch integrator th
	verify on linux for GTK and lesstif.  This is a bit hackish on detecting the alt key/option key, I
	#ifdefed it to __APPLE__ because the option key returns 1<<13 not
	GDK_MOD1_MASK Under lesstif I might guess that the alt/mod1 is not
	quite the same as option.

	use mouse resources I had some free time over the weekend and have been wanting to get
	my hands dirty in the PCB code so I took a crack at this and wanted
	to get some feedback.  Attached is a patch with a detailed commit message of what I did,
	but the general idea was to move the lesstif hid's handling of the
	mouse resources into a common hid file (which I called hid_resource)
	and have the gtk hid use that instead of being hardcoded.  This way
	the hid's are only responsible for catching the button press,
	determining which modifier keys were active, then calling the common
	code to handle it.  The common code does what the lesstif hid does,
	calls the actions defined in the resource file.  In theory more
	common stuff could be moved to hid_resource, the code to find and
	load the resource file, for example, is nearly identical in both
	hids.  I changed up the Mouse resource in gpcb-menu.res to match the
	hardcoded behavior of the gtk hid as closely as possible (see the
	commit message for details).  I've played around with it a bit and it seems to be working, but as
	this my first time meddling with the code, I'm sure I missed some
	stuff.  If anybody has time to look it over and/or try it out that
	would be great.  Comments regarding the approach, formatting, style,
	etc. are all appreciated (I did my best to match the style of the
	surrounding code).  Jared

	* src/edif.y: Use the appropriate header files instead of providing
	extern foo() prototypes.  Use the correct headers for a handful of function prototypes.  This
	should fix some build issues reported on geda-uers.

2009-06-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: When building from git sources and building docs,
	force maintainer-mode.  When building from git sources, maintainer mode is required to build
	the manual.  So, unless the user has specified --disable-doc then
	force maintainer mode.  When building from a tarball, the
	preformatted manual is already contained and we do not impose
	maintainer-mode.  Hopefully this puts to rest the documentation
	building issues once and for all!

2009-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/pcb.pot: Remove generated file that cause continual git churn.  This file is generated and also removed by the clean target.
	Removing a file from the source tree via 'make clean' that is under

	* doc/fractional_size.texi, doc/letter_size.texi,

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/pcbfile.texi, doc/version.texi: remove some
	generated files from git.  These are only needed if you are building
	the documentation in which case you have all the tools and makefile
	rules for them to be regenrated anyway.  Eliminates all the
	headaches associated with generated files in version control.

	gschemrc at configure time.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/POTFILES.in: add a missing file.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, doc/gs/Makefile.inc,
	lib/Makefile.am: Remove the use of maintainer mode to gate on/off
	rules for building the documentation.  Instead look for the
	existance of $(top_srcdir)/.git and decide based on that if this is
	a tarball build (in which case the documentation ships already
	built) or a git build.  If it is a git build, then simply require
	all the needed tools for building the docs.  If the tools are not
	found then configure will exit with an explicit message saying why
	it has failed and that either tools need to be installed or
	--disable-doc needs to be given.  Hopefully this will eliminate the
	previous strange behavior of needing --maintainer-mode when building
	docs from cvs/git.

2009-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am: add gts/predicates_init.h to DISTCLEANFILES.
	Also comment out the section that extracts REGISTER lines from the
	gts code.  We currently don't have any REGISTER lines in the gts
	code and so make was exiting because a grep failed.

2009-05-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc, lib/to.inc: Add TO18, TO39, and fix pinout on TO92.  Added TO18 and TO39 footprints based on the JEDEC drawings.  Note
	that the pinout used is the one from the JEDEC drawings and it may
	or may not match a particular vendors pin numbering.  I have in fact
	seen different vendors number the pins differently on these
	packages.  It is entirely up to the user to make sure that their CAD
	symbols have the correct mapping from E, B, C (for a bipolar) to
	pins 1, 2, 3 and that the JEDEC numbering is used.  While here correct the TO92 pinout.  It now also matches the JEDEC
	drawing and is more consistent with the most common vendor
	numberings.  How on earth has this not caused problems before?

2009-05-17   Jared Casper * jaredcasper AT gmail dot com *

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac, src/hid/lpr/hid.conf: Some cleanup of
	configure script Added top level check for pkg-config with PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG and
	removed AC_PATH_PROG call for pkg-config from inside a block
	conditional on enable_dbus.  Added a PKG_CHECK_MODULE for cairo if the toporouter output is
	enabled.  Added a check for HID dependencies.  A hid's hid.conf can set a
	variable "deps" which is a list of other HIDs that must be included
	with that hid.  Added ps the lpr's deps.

2009-05-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	switches off toporouter --disable-toporouter-output switches off
	toporouter cairo output 3) make toporouter compatible with glib < 2.10.0 provide
	slist_insert_sorted_with_data() for those cases 4) fix VPATH builds gts/predicates_init stuff was not quite clean 5) fix find_closest() implementation for glib < 2.4.0 The earlier
	version combined with toporouter produced segfault on tut1.pcb (on
	top of glib-2.0.1 and glib-2.6.4); furthermore, it accessed to
	undocumented glib structures.

	window to be more compatible Avoid using the attribute alias "font_size" in the markup. Older
	pango versions only support "size", which is functionally identical.

	src/hid/lpr/lpr.c, src/hid/nelma/nelma.c, src/hid/png/png.c,
	src/hid/ps/eps.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c: Refactor DRC reporting to work
	around a DrcViolationType structure.  Add hooks to the HID structure allowing a GUI to consume this data
	directly (if it wants), rather than being called to display ordinary
	message dialog boxes. No HID yet utilises this interface.  Remove log messages for individual design rule violations, instead
	writing log entries based on the title in the DrcViolationType. This
	modifies some of the logged messages slightly. All now prefix:
	"WARNING!  Design Rule error - ", as was present on some of the old
	messges.

2009-04-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix leak of input objects for certain short-cut
	cases in poly_Boolean_free When either a or b input object is NULL, depending on the boolean
	operation selected, either a, b or NULL is returned as the result.
	Make sure we free any non NULL, and non-returned inputs when taking
	these shortcut paths.

2009-04-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: Fix leak of cross vertex connectivity lists when
	deleting contours Free these lists as we free the contour's nodes in poly_DelContour()

2009-03-25   Tibor Palinkas * igor2 AT inno dot bme dot hu *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: pass context in lesstif Minor patch to get the action context properly passed to actions
	with lesstif, which doesn't use hid_actionv() for some reason.

2009-03-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/hidint.h,
	src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: single-action register/deregister New API to support registering individual actions with a context for
	them, for example for scripting languages to register a hub
	dispatcher.   From Igor2 AT inno dot bme dot hu (Tibor Palinkas)

2009-03-08   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/report.c: bugfix: avoid NULL pin names with Report(NetLength) There was an assumption that all pins and pads have non-NULL names,
	but if you create a .pcb with a script you could end up with
	anything.  Make sure the names we get are non-NULL before using
	them.

2009-03-06   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c, src/hid/png/png.c: Fix exporters to cope
	with hairlines now they are passed as width 0, not 1 This fixes breakage introduced in commit
	8dd739f9bd72dc3c8beb6e4e5e32c124cac0d13b png exporter:   - Needs a minimum 1x1 pixel brush for drawing hairlines    - Report and patch by Levente Kovacs * leventelist AT gmail dot

2009-03-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots: Add a note for next time about some increased
	test coverage.  We need to do a distcheck build with a wider variety of requested
	HID's to catch things like the missing src/hid/batch/hid.conf

2009-03-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am: add missing hid/batch/hid.conf to EXTRA_DIST.
	Noted by Stefan Salewski.

2009-02-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: Bump the required autoconf version to 2.60.  pdfdir, psdir, and friends appeared in version 2.60 of autoconf.
	Since we use those, we need 2.60 or higher.  Problem noted by Bert
	Timmerman.

2009-02-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	src/hid/nelma/nelma.c, src/hid/png/png.c, src/hid/ps/eps.c,
	src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Add support for
	filling / thindrawing raw polygons to the HID interface Refactor core polygon drawing to use these member functions, and
	split the old code which used the HID's fill_polygon and draw_line
	functions into a helper function which the guis now use to convert
	the polygon into the primitives it knows how to draw.  Alter the NoHoles dicer to pass back PLINE contours, rather than
	wrapping them in a POLYAREA and PolygonType.

2009-02-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c, src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Add user_data parameter
	to NoHolesPolygonDicer Also switch the clip_box parameter before the ones defining the
	callback and its user_data.

2009-02-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Thindraw with 0 width, not 1 PCB unit width.  This allows the gui to differentiate between when the core wants
	hairline drawing, and when the core is drawing primitives which are
	actually 1 PCB unit wide.

2009-02-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Thindraw polygons with circular line-caps.  Set an explicit cap style for consistency with other "special"
	polygon drawing code.

2009-02-17   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c: Bisect and union self-intersecting arcs in
	ArcPoly() Avoids creating a self-intersecting contour which produces incorrect
	result. Bug noted when clearing a 360 degree arc from a polygon.  For self-intersecting arcs, we now bisect, produce two polygons
	(with non-self-intersecting contours), then compute their union.

	src/hid/nelma/nelma.c, src/hid/png/png.c, src/hid/ps/eps.c,
	src/hid/ps/ps.c: Various HIDs: Add missing pointers for the watch
	and block hander methods These were missed when adding DBus support, since the initialisation
	of the HID structure assumes that unspecified members are zero, and
	all subsequent function pointers were explicitly 0, so as not to
	cause a type mismatch.  Hids fixed:   bom   gerber   lpr   nelma   png   eps   ps

2009-02-10   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/nelma/nelma.c: nelma: Fix prototype on set_layer() method
	to take the "empty" flag.  Fixes warning about incompatible types when intialising the HID
	structure.

2009-02-10   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon1.c: polygon1.c: Implement poly_Boolean() by calling
	poly_Boolean_free() Reduces duplicated code. The poly_Boolean() implemetation already
	copied the original contours, then duplicated the processing steps
	taken in poly_Boolean_free().

2009-02-08   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: gtkhid: Return NULL from
	ghid_get_net_from_node_name() Fixes calling return; from function returning non-void type.

2009-02-08   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/crosshair.c: crosshair.c: When drawing via DRC clearence, pass
	correct angle.  360 * 64 was a hold-over from before the HID split. The passed angle
	should be 360.

2009-01-24   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h, src/rats.c: Make rats to polygons

	* src/action.c: Handle wrap-around when searching the string hash
	table.

2009-01-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: for the axial footprints, put the mark on pin 1
	instead of on the body of the footprint.  This gives you a much
	better chance of the pins being on-grid when working with the
	coarser grids typically found in a thru-hole design.

2008-12-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/polygon.c: Add description of how polygon data works from Ben,
	and debug routines for dumping polygon structures within gdb.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Fix off-by one error in the GTK
	HID's netlist window model generation Broken when I added support for a hierarchical view of nets. The bug
	caused invalid memory to be read, possibly leading to a crash, as
	the last (and missing) element from g_new0 was supposed to be a

2008-12-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/parse_l.l: Add support for suffixes on numbers, like "mm",

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/version.texi, lib/Makefile.am,

	* doc/actions.texi: regen

2008-12-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.am,
	lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh: Correctly deal with the case where one wants
	to do a maintainer cross compile which requires an installed pcb
	that can be executed on the build host.  As part of this, also do
	not build the png previews of the pcblib-newlib library by default.
	They were not really used for anything and it really slows the
	build.  They can be built with --enable-m4lib-png.

2008-12-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: check for windres as a build tool
	instead of hard coding 'windres'.  Should help with cross-compiling
	with windows as the target.  Noted as a patch for gerbv by Cesar
	Strauss.

	* src/global.h, src/hid/common/hidinit.c,

2008-11-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: create a DOS batch file wrapper for the installer

	* win32/Makefile.am, win32/build_pcb, win32/extract_gtk_win32,
	win32/pcb.nsi.in, win32/registerExtension.nsh: - various minor updates for a more recent download of gtk and
	  friends largely taken from gerbv.  - associate .pcb and .fp file extensions with pcb - make sure we start up pcb in the My Documents area to discourage   writing into Program Files.

2008-11-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* po/POTFILES.in: add 2 missing files that have translations

2008-11-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Fix the foo.ps.type.ps bug

2008-11-19   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/djopt.c: Move splitlines even earlier, to avoid unwanted
	changes.

2008-11-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/create.c: Don't merge two lines if the join flag differs.

2008-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-pinout-preview.c: Fix preview drawing broken by
	resetting "Gathering" mode after painting.  Seems that the pinout preview widget relied on the bug fixed in
	commit 0647d028e6c755715d2fcdbd0b4f2be73d36ae7f. In the expose
	handler of the preview, We should be calling the
	hid_expose_callback() function rather than DrawElement() directly.

2008-10-21   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Remove logged warning when
	pressing a key with no defined binding Poping up the log window in these cases is very intrusive, and it
	triggered for keys such as capslock, Mod4/Windows etc. There is no
	real need to log errant key-presses, so remove this feature.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/autoroute.c, src/mtspace.c: Fix two assertion test to allow
	compiling a debug build.  Due to code-restructures, a couple of assert tests (not normally
	compiled) had bit-rotted. Remove one, rejig the other.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: rtree.c: Fix typo in assertion test inside __r_search Caused false assertion failures when running a debugging build.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/search.c: Fix IsPointInBox to work with wide as well as tall
	boxes Actually implement the test, rather than trying to construct a pad
	to test which has the right geometry.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: Change rtree penalty function in rtree.c to use
	doubles, not long long.  Since the exact integer result doesn't matter, this is ok.
	Marginally faster on Core Duo machine.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/rtree.c: Check all r-tree node children for fit before working
	out penalties Working out the penalty involves multiplications which produce a
	"long long" result, and is seen to be appear in profiling.  Make a pass at testing all children for the fast case of the child
	node containing the desired box, before working out size penalties
	to expanding each child.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/heap.c: Increase initial heap size from 32 to 256 In complex boards with lots of polygons, we were realloc'ing up to
	this kind of number anyway, in x2 size steps. Save all the
	memcpy'ing by making the heap larger to start with.  My test board still has some requirement for heaps >256, <512, but
	the frequency is low.

2008-10-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: GTK HID: Raise already open command
	window to top with ":" key Previously, ":" only opened the window, but would not raise it if
	already open.

2008-10-02   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/move.c: Fix array index out of bounds over layer groups Off by one error in for loop, picked out by a recent version of GCC
	being better at spotting this kind of bug. The effects (if any) this
	bug caused are unknown.

2008-10-01   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: GTK HID: Fix crash when
	highlighting connectivity caused by net tree.  Seems I caused a crash in the connectivity highlighting code which
	assumed the net model of in the netlist window is a list structure
	where each element represents a net. Adapted the code to hunt out
	the right net / node with a tree model of nets.

2008-10-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots, utils/cvs2cl.pl: add a local coyp of cvs2cl.pl

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: Don't bother unsubtracting complex
	polygons when doing incremental updates Since the polygon is re-cleared against any objects existing within
	the bounding box of the update region, there is no point wasting CPU
	cycles intersecting a more complex polygon than necessary. Just take
	the UNION of the polygon being unsubtracted, and the bounding box of
	the hole to be filed in.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c, src/polygon.c: Fix text bounds to include the area
	cleared into a polygon Fixes re-clearing the polygon when a closely touching object is
	incrementally updated.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Ensure "Gathering" mode is set after painting the
	screen.  In between repaints initiated from the GUI, with this flag set, all
	Draw{object_type} operations just update a dirtied bounds. A final
	Draw() call then calls the HID to invalidate the bounds gathered.  Setting "Gathering = True" after an expose event callback ensures
	subsequent drawing is batched up for the next screen update.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Add debugging code to visually check a pad's bounding
	box Proved useful in fixing the pad bounding box update routine.
	Disabled with #if 0 block.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c, src/move.h: Fix bounding boxes for rotated square
	ended pads.  Bounding box compution only worked for round ended pads before.  In
	addition, the "move" code previously called SetLineBoundingBox for
	pads, which computes the wrong result.

2008-09-30   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-library-window.c: GTK HID: Make double clicking on
	a footprint library expand / contract it Usability improvement.

	* src/buffer.c: Put exploded pads on the correct layer

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Display nets as a hierarchical
	tree in the netlist window.  The view splits netnames at "/" characters, and builds the netlist
	view as a tree accordingly. Allows more strutured viewing of nets
	coming from hierarchical designs.

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Improve hashing algorithm for storing
	color data Curosry testing showed the old algorithm encountered a lot of hash
	collisions. Swap to a more sensible hashing algorithm.

2008-09-23   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Fix lru heuristic to shortcut color

2008-04-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/edif.y, src/puller.c: Fix some code before declarations bugs

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/action.c: Applied patch from Tomaz Solc fixing crosshair
	issues with ActionNew() ActionNew() function didn't call a RestoreCrosshair() after a
	HideCrosshair() in most cases.  This causes symptoms similar to those described in #1900255 when
	"Start new layout" is selected in the File menu in GTK HID (most
	probably also in Lesstiff, but I haven't checked).  This patch adds two missing RestoreCrosshair() calls and fixes that
	issue.  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/misc.c: Applied patch from Tomaz Solc fixing a bug in the
	CenterDisplay function.  This patch fixes a bug in the CenterDisplay function that doesn't do
	a RestoreCrosshair() after HideCrosshair().  This causes the crosshair stack overflow when using the DRC checker
	(which calls CenterDisplay a lot).  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/crosshair.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Applied patch
	from Tomaz Solc fixing bug #1882970.  This patch fixes a bug where objects attached to the cursor (line
	segments during drawing, etc.) permanently disappear if mouse cursor
	leaves a window during dragging.  Minor re-indentation by Peter Clifton during application.

2008-04-13   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Apply patch from Igor to ensure when

	close_confirm_dialog() for closing modified layouts.  This allows GUI HIDs to present a more native looking "save before
	closing" dialog. The HID is responsible for any save which the user
	requests and the subsequent return codes from the HID are as before,
	0 for cancel and 1 for close.  This checkin also fixes the GTK HID's Save() action to return 1 for
	cancel if the user cancels from the "Save As" dialog.

2008-03-30   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/misc.c: If a layer selected through --layer-stack isn't found,

2008-03-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Ignore zero-radius filled circles.

2008-03-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c, src/parse_y.y: Only use the min annular ring parameter
	for checking the annular rings on pins and vias.  Previously the
	minimum copper width setting was also used.  Changed after a
	discussion on geda-user.  Also make sure we use the minimum copper
	width as the default if the .pcb file doesn't specify the minimum
	annulus.

2008-03-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Add a missing terminating '*' on the

2008-02-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am: revert most of the previous commit which
	accidentally added some stuff that was not meant to be checked in.

2008-02-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/pcbtest.sh.in: use absolute paths (set at

	as part of a test suite.

2008-02-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add 128 pin 14x14 mm LQFP with exposed padded.  Add

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid.h,

2008-01-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, data/Makefile.am, icon-theme-installer: 
	check for gtk-update-icon-cache and use it.  For distcheck, disable
	that via setting the GTK_UPDATE_ICON_CACHE_BIN to 'true' to avoid
	creating a cache file which then is not removed.  A better way would

	/bin/ksh instead of the broken solaris /bin/sh

2008-01-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2007-11-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Draw arc start/end radii in separate
	colors, and dotted, if enabled.

2007-11-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c, src/draw.h: Export DrawLayer() for the ps exporter.

2007-11-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Draw outline layer on all other copper layers
	when "draw outline" is selected.  Make alignment marks less
	obtrusive.  Make drill helpers half the board's minimum drill size,
	not twice PCB's minimum drill size.  Include commented out helpers
	for brass paste stencil etching.

2007-11-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/undo.c: Don't just clean out RemoveList, free it, so it's
	created properly later.

2007-11-25   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/polyarea.h: Add some prototypes for global functions returning
	double that will confuse the heck out of you if treated as returning
	int!

2007-11-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/netlist.c: Don't crash if a scanned element has no
	text.

2007-11-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/library.c: lesstif_show_library: Don't reset the
	dialog when we're just re-displaying it.

2007-11-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Apply [ 1726201 ] SaveTo(PasteBuffer.file) for
	footprint creation with cleanups (original patch from Christian
	Riggenbach - gizmotron)

2007-11-23   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/actionlist.c: Remove obsolete (generated, even!) file

2007-11-23   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/pcb-menu.res: Change all the GetXY prompts
	for greater clarity.

2007-11-23   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Apply patch [ 1835365 ] Fix for [
	1820385 ] Can't close the preference dialog from denis77

2007-11-23   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/autoroute.c: LIST_LOOP works on circular lists, but at least
	some code will produce a head pointer of NULL for an empty list,
	causing LIST_LOOP to crash.  Since I'm not sure which is the bug, I
	changed LIST_LOOP to assert() on a NULL list head and skip the loop.
	With assert disabled, the loop becomes a no-op, which seems
	appropriate.

2007-11-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/search.c, src/search.h: Additional slanted-pad patch for
	missed DRC

2007-11-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	a bashism (== vs =).

2007-11-18   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* globalconst.h: Expand min/max values.

2007-11-14   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/misc.c, src/parse_y.y: Fix pin bound calculations based on new
	thermal calculations.

2007-11-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/crosshair.c: Snap to pin/pads whenever we're within the
	pin/pad copper, unless shift is pressed, then snap to the nearest
	grid point if it's closer.

2007-11-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/hidnogui.c: Don't complain about checking the shift
	key when exporting pngs from the command line.

2007-11-12   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/buffer.c: Fix bugs intoduced by revision 1.41 while preserving
	the fixes in 1.41.

2007-11-10   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* lib/connector.inc: Reduce silk width of connector/header/jumpers
	(some fabs clip it to the pads) to be similar to other elements.

2007-11-10   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* lib/qfpdj.inc, lib/smt.inc: Move silk away from pads.  Fix notch
	in SO footprints.

2007-11-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: fix DIN41651_20 and DIN41651_20S.  Those are 20 pin
	footprints not 10 pin footprints.  Reported by Marshall Jose.

2007-11-04   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/change.c, src/change.h, src/move.c, src/polygon.c,
	src/rotate.c, src/strflags.c: Add support for clearing text from
	polygons.  Text with the clearline flag (set with the J key by
	default, just like lines and arcs) will have a rounded rectangle
	hole cut in any overlapping polygons.

2007-11-04   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Shift-click with the via tool to connect it to the
	current layer as you place it.

2007-11-04   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/netlist.c, src/netlist.c, src/rats.h: Plumb the
	NetlistShow() hid action in lesstif.  Takes a pin name or a net name
	and sets the current selection in the netlist window.  Does not pop
	up the netlist.

2007-11-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi: regen

2007-11-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: Properly thin-draw slanted pads.

2007-11-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/find.c, src/polygon.c, src/search.c, src/search.h: Fixes for
	DRC of slanted pads.  Tracker bug 1791388 and patch 1791392.

2007-11-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: Don't draw pins/holes on the outline layer.  Include
	commented-out code to put board outline on mask layers, for fabs
	that need that.

2007-11-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/buffer.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/select.c: fix some compiler
	warnings

2007-11-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: Improve the robustness of the makeinfo version test.
	Patch provided by Peter Brett.

2007-11-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Don't segfault when clicking the top
	right button which toggles units.  Problem noted by and solution
	provided by Christian Riggenbach.

2007-10-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/search.c: Treat VIAFLAG rats (displayed as donuts) as round
	targets, not as the invisible lines they are internally.

2007-10-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: Make sure the leftmost end of the line
	is visible in the log window.

2007-10-21   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Fix printf format warnings.

2007-10-21   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/crosshair.c, src/draw.c, src/rats.c: Ratlist generation is
	changed to favor connecting to polygons when they are available and
	surround the pin needing a connection.  Such rats are still
	internally lines to the corner of the polygon, but have the VIAFLAG
	set.  The drawing code is modified to show them as little donuts
	(suggesting the via that would be used to connect the pin, vs a
	line).  The crosshair rubberband code is modified to NOT draw these
	lines while dragging.  These changes are forward and backward
	compatible.

2007-10-21   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/find.c, src/find.h: Make DRC dialog
	next/continue to clarify its function.  When DRC is over, message
	now indicates if it was cancelled (so log can distinguish lack of
	DRC errors from aborted DRC).

2007-10-20   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/rubberband.c: The correct point on a line now moves with a
	polygon (fix cut'n'paste typo) When you move a line endpoint, only
	*exactly* connected lines go with you.  When you move a line, if
	another segment fully overlaps the end of the moving line, the
	entire segment (not an arbitrary end of it) will move.  When you
	move an element, any segments completely covered by a pad move with
	the pad.  (there are still some bugs in the drawing code as you
	drag??)

2007-10-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix some really broken spurious panning
	of the drawing area which happens when the board is viewed from the
	back.  Reported by Peter Clifton who also helped getting this patch
	working right.

2007-10-04   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Reject double and triple clicks
	in ghid_port_button_press_cb() Fixes a bug where a component would be rotated by more steps than
	desired if clicking quickly with the rotate tool.

2007-09-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/polygon.c: Change rendering of rounded corners used when
	clearing polygons.  This fixes a slight rotation in rounded
	rectangles and asymmetry of all rounded clearances besides complete
	circles (which were not affected by the bug).  For an illustration,
	see:  http://ad7gd.net/geda/roundrectanim.gif (include error code
	print in returns from the polygon code -- not much use)

2007-09-24   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/autoroute.c: Add (under ifdef) code I used to debug a report
	of "The rats nest is stale! Aborting autoroute...".  It leaves the
	rat in question selected after the error.

2007-09-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: add missing 2007 in copyright year (for all the gtk
	usermenu stuff)

2007-09-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: avoid free()-ing some memory a bit
	too soon.  Patch from Ineiev.

2007-09-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/pcb-menu.res: use mil and mm instead of
	mils and mms for grid units

2007-09-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Add missing else.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/buffer.c: Fix bugs with undoing "group" moves of objects over
	a polygon.  The group code uses the buffer code (sort of an
	automatic cut/paste) so it applies to inserting elements and using
	the buffers as well.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/action.c: Fix [ 1751568 ] shorted nets stay orange after
	fixing and re-opt netlist

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/rotate.c: Fix [ 1751574 ] undoing rotation that put an elt
	inside a poly didn't fix plow Properly restores/clears rubber band
	lines during rotate and undo.  Still shockingly slow if you try this
	on an even moderately full board!

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/find.c, src/rtree.h: Search for rat-end connections using 3x3
	"fat" ends to avoid having rat-to-polygon-corner connections missed.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/select.c: Fix [ 1751566 ] When 'far side' hidden, hidden
	elements don't deselect Change the SelectBlock to ignore visibility
	for deselect while looping over all elements.  The diffs are large
	because the original code used VISIBLE_*_LOOP so all of the looping
	was replaced.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/search.c: Apply [ 1751580 ] polys should not be
	selectable/considered when thin-drawn

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/search.c: Fix the crash from [ 1724453 ] PCB Crashes with bad
	footprint (in its library) Does not fix whatever bug in the input
	allowed a bogus element in (see bug for description of the problem
	with the element and the source of the bad element).

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/remove.c: Fix bugs 1751572 and 1743534 by allowing a remove on
	an endpoint to delete the segment if it's not just deleting a kink
	from a longer line.

2007-09-08   Ben Jackson * ben AT ben dot com *

	* src/move.c: Fix [ 1751578 ] 'move to current layer' doesn't
	re-plow polygon correctly by clearing the NEW line pointer instead
	of the old (destroyed) one.

2007-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/dil.inc: Patch [ 1784693 ] Fix Mark position for SDIP packages

2007-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: Add newlib/keystone/Makefile.  Forgot to
	check this in earlier.

	* newlib/Makefile.am, newlib/Makefile.in,
	newlib/keystone/KEYSTONE_1062.fp, newlib/keystone/Makefile.am,
	newlib/keystone/Makefile.in: add Keystone SMT battery holder for

2007-09-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in, lib/candk.inc, lib/common.m4,
	lib/nichicon.inc, lib/optek.inc: Add C&K ES series switches, Optek
	white LED, and Nichicon WT series of SMT electrolytics.

2007-09-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: gut
	ghid_print_dialog() and use the attribute editor to do all of the
	dialog box work.  Removes a bunch of duplicated code.

	->fileselect() function to the HID interface.  Now actions can use
	gui->fileselect() instead of gui->prompt_for() when they are
	specifically looking for a file.  Currently the gtk HID implements
	this and the lesstif one has the old behaviour.  While messing around with dialogs, add a "descr" argument to the
	attribute editor.  That can be used as a tooltip, help string, or
	ignored.

2007-08-26   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Fixed .ps output with "drill-copper" and
	"drill-helper" options.  Holes in the soldermask (and other non-copper layers) are now drawn
	correctly when the "drill-copper" option is set to false. With the
	"drill-helper" option on, only holes on copper layers are affected.

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c, src/hid/ps/eps.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c: 
	Gerber, PS, and EPS ignore the thindraw settings.  Fix bug in PS
	when first item on the board is an arc.  PS "drill helper" changed
	to a simple hole reduction so that copper extends to drilled hole
	even when hole is off-center.

2007-08-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Don't free home_pcbmenu until after it's
	used.

2007-06-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Don't forget to fclose() the config file
	after we're done reading it.  CID 27, scan #1.

2007-06-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/bom/bom.c: Fix a few memory leaks.  Coverity ID 22, 23,
	and 24, scan #1.

2007-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: add missing save_syntax and save_help.
	Also allow Save(PasteBuffer) so we have more compatibility with the
	lesstif HID.  This also fixes the regression about saving buffer
	elements which appeared after the user menu branch was merged.

2007-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: add Save(PasteBuffer) to save_syntax.

2007-06-09   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/pcb-menu.res: Add Delete() action.  No
	arguments: delete selected ELSE object, but options for selected
	only, object only, selected rats, all rats.

2007-05-29   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Revert patch to hide far-side (invisible) pads when
	near-side pins / pads are switched off. Old behaviour was
	intentional.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add option "drill-copper" to draw / not draw
	drill holes in the copper layers of the ps exporter. This is useful
	for plated through processes which require the etch mask to protect
	the vias / pins during etching.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Change drawing code for square pads to use
	gui->fill_rect (...) as on Win32, the current method of drawing a
	zero length line doesn't work.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/draw.c: Stop far side 'invisible' pads being drawn when pins /
	pads are switched off.

2007-05-25   Peter Clifton * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix drawing of filled rectangles when
	the board is flipped.  Makes soldermask view  on the back of the
	board work.

2007-05-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2007-05-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: check for buggy versions of m4 which seem to think
	eval(-2/2) should be 2147483647.  Noted by Peter Clifton.

2007-05-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Avoid a stack corruption.  Noted by
	Peter Clifton.  Should probably replace all instances of sprintf in
	pcb with snprintf, but that will take some work.

2007-05-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c, src/main.c: 
	check for getenv() return codes everywhere and deal if getenv
	returns NULL.  Noted by Peter Clifton.

2007-05-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: if the popen fails for the ListLibraryContents.sh
	shell script, continue on with the newlib processing instead of
	failing.  This helps on systems where either the user has disabled
	m4 libraries or on systems like windows where the popen will not
	work.

2007-05-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/todo: remove a few fixed things

2007-05-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/connector.inc: Increase the hole size on the DIN* connectors
	(are these named wrong btw?) from 28 mils to 40 mils.  This is more
	in line with what is recommended for Tyco *-1634689-* box headers in
	Tyco drawing 1634689.  Noted by Seb James.

2007-05-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c: When refusing to create overlapping vias spit out a
	warning.  We should probably allow overlapping vias but turn it into
	a DRC violation.  But until then, at least give a warning instead of
	silently dropping them.  More details are in bug reports: [ 1687692
	] Large Pads (150 mils) silently dropped [ 1266154 ] lost vias

2007-05-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/misc.c: avoid triggering an emergency
	save on normal exit.  Reported and patch provided in bug [ 1705607 ]
	Emergency save on normal exit.

2007-05-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-pinout-window.c: - make arcs show up in the pinout window - don't rotate the element in the pinout window.  Rather display
	  with the same rotation as in the layout.  Besides being more useful
	  this avoid a segfault in some cases.

2007-05-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res: remove the menu mneumonics as some conflict
	with hotkeys

2007-05-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Teach the GTK HID how to trap certain hotkeys
	which gtk usually captures for its own use.  This lets PCB use the
	arrow keys and the tab key again.  So restore the hotkey for
	flipping sides in the menu resource file.  Start on the Cursor()
	action which is needed for the arrow keys.  That part is not done
	yet.

2007-04-28   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: Don't double the pad thickness when restoring to
	the polygon.  For speedup, just add back a simple rectangle since it
	only has 4 points. Should do that for lines too, but didn't.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-04-27   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: fix bloating of region to search for re-clearance
	after a portion of polyogn is restored.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-04-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	Noted in bug [ 1657886 ] Check return codes everywhere

2007-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gpcb-menu.res, src/pcb-menu.res: Change "Select all" to
	"Select all visible" to match up with what actually happens.
	Reported in bug [ 1013719 ] Select all objects: misleading name?

	src/hid/gtk/gui.h, src/misc.c, src/pcbtest.sh.in, src/set.c,
	src/todo: Merge the usermenu branch.   This reworks how the menus
	and hotkeys are defined and handled for the gtk HID.  In particular,
	instead of being hard coded, the menus are loaded from a menu
	resource file like in the lesstif gui.  All hotkeys are defined via
	the menu hotkeys and thus are visually presented in the menus.  The
	gtk HID looks for "gpcb-menu.res" instead of "pcb-menu.res" so that
	the menu organization may be different between the lesstif and gtk
	HID's.

2007-04-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/change.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c,

	src/misc.c, src/output.c, src/output.h, src/set.c, src/thermal.c: 
	Remove references to the now unused output.h.  To help keep it that
	way, go ahead and remove the unused output.c and output.h files.

2007-04-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/command.c: Allow :s without filename to use current filename.

2007-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	src/hid/nelma/hid.conf, src/hid/nelma/nelma.c,
	src/hid/nelma/nelma.h: add the nelma export HID provided in patch: [

	me.

2007-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: Apply patch supplied in patch [

2007-04-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Initialize command history size to 5 if
	no config setting is given.  Patch [ 1608559 ] Patch for command
	entry history bug.

2007-04-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c: add distance and angle to the relative
	readout.  Mostly provided in patch submission [ 1621913 ] Euclidian
	distance from mark.  Minor update (fix the fact that in PCB units,
	positive Y is down) from me.

2007-04-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/parse_y.y: turn on the code which
	marks the file format version in the file.  pcb has had the code in
	place for a bit now that parses that and gives a warning if the
	version of pcb is not new enough to read the current file version.

2007-04-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: prevent the
	cursor position labels from growing/shrinking as you move the cursor
	around.

2007-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/flags.c: Change the stringflag in the settings from showdrc to
	showdrcmode since we already used showdrc for the flag.  This fixes
	the menu choice for "crosshairs show drc clearance".

2007-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rats.c: avoid using an unitialized variable (even though we

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-03-10   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rats.c: Handle case for connections are close to or beyond

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/clip.c, src/clip.h,
	src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Add basic line
	clipping to both GUIs.

2007-03-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: Fix a bug when looking for square pad to square pad
	clearance.  The old way simply grew one of the pads by Bloat on all
	4 sides and looked for overlap.  This is not the correct test in the
	case where the closest line between the two pads is a unique line
	from two of the corners.  The new way should correctly handle all
	cases.

	src/pcb-menu.res, src/report.c, src/search.c, src/set.c,
	src/strflags.c, src/strflags.h, src/todo: Made flags type big enough
	to hold PCB flags.  Added hash table for parameter lookup in action.c Moved thindraw code out of lesstif hid.  Added "thin draw polygons" flag to toplevel stuff.  Fixed "check polygons" so it works again.  Added "lock names" setting: When set, the arrow tool ignores element
	names and text objects, so you can select the elements or objects
	beneath them.  Added "only names" setting: When set, the arrow tool can only select
	element names and text objects; you won't accidentally move an
	element.  Made the crosshair-move code draw the outline of pads, not the
	centerline.  It does still draw round-end pads as rectangles,
	though.  Allow "--no-foo" to shut off boolean "--foo" options that default to
	on.  Added "--layer-stack" option that takes a string and sets the layer
	stack to it (for eps/png export, mostly).  Layers are numbers
	0..N-1, the names of the layers from the loaded PCB file, or the
	special names "rats", "invisible", "pins", "vias", or "elements".
	Layers may be separated by spaces, commas, semicolons, or colons.  Added Display(Step,[1..9]) to move the cursor in steps.  Implemented
	in lesstif HID, attached to arrow keys.  Added "what to do with the
	pointer" parameter - warp pointer to match crosshair, or pan window
	to put crosshair under cursor.  Make autorouter show live trials.  Clean up various FIXMEs.  Add support for string encoded PCB flags.  thindraw exports: off by default?  Follow current setting?  Or put
	it in their own attribute list? Added Report(NetLength) which reports on the total length of
	segments (lines and arcs) for the net under the cursor.  It will
	also tell you the name of the net.  Remove obsolete UseLogWindow and RaiseLogWindow.

2007-03-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/pcb.nsi.in: remove some left over links on uninstall

2007-02-27   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2007-02-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/file.c, src/parse_y.y: Allow the user to load a footprint as a

2007-02-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/report.c: Report on pads as rectangles, not lines, so we get

	a filename conflict on case insensitive file systems (pcb vs Pcb).

2007-02-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/create.c: Always initialize default layer names.

2007-02-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c: use MAX_LAYER in a spot instead of max_layer.
	Prevents a segfault with the lesstif hid.

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, src/main.c: if we somehow fail to find
	the install path from lrealpath(argv[0]) or by searching through the
	PATH environment variable, fall back to the configure time path
	which is compiled into the binary.

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi: regen

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Modify how the dependencies work
	a bit for the newlib library that is generated from the m4
	libraries.  In particular, make sure that a normal user building
	from a tarball doesn't have to build the libraries since they take
	quite a bit of time.  Also make sure things work with a read-only
	source tree.

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: When pcb is called with no path, i.e. "pcb" instead of
	"../src/pcb" or /usr/local/bin/pcb, then we can't just look at
	argv[0] to figure out the installation path.  In this situation,
	search through PATH to find which pcb was called.  Should fix
	problems noted on geda-dev by Tomaz Solc.

2007-02-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* : remove these generated files

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots: update for 20070208 snapshot

2007-02-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: add a GIF AM_CONDITIONAL to go along with the PNG
	one

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: s/pcb-bin/pcb

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: fix botched commit

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: add a --enable-maintainer-mode flag

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/pcb.nsi.in: Include in the installer the licenses for the
	included libraries (gd, png, jpeg, freetype, zlib).

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb, win32/pcb.nsi.in: Add in the png HID to the
	non-cygwin windows build.

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: When generating the previews of the
	footprints, run pcb on an input and output file in the current
	directory instead of a different directory.  This becomes important
	on filesystems that use \ instead of / for the directory separator.

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: On non-cygwin windows, look
	for -lbgd instead of -lgd since the former is what is available as a
	pre-build dll.

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: remove some illegal casts to unions.

2007-02-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: the executible is now pcb not pcb-bin

2007-02-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/parse_l.l: If the passed path to Parse is "" then don't use
	it.

2007-02-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	work on the relocatability stuff to handle the annoying "\" instead
	of "/" for directory separators in windows.  Use ";" instead of ":"
	for path seperators under windows since it is common to have
	"c:\some\path".  With this change things seem to work under
	non-cygwin windows.

2007-02-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/pcb.nsi.in: install pcb.exe instead of pcb-bin.exe

	newlib directories, some poorly maintained footprints, and some
	"heavy" footprints.  There is still much more to be done but this is
	a start.

2007-02-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, doc/actions.texi,
	doc/pcb.texi, doc/version.texi, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	src/file.c, src/global.h, src/hid/common/hidinit.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c, src/pcbtest.sh.in,
	src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in, src/script/pcb.in: 
	Take a stab at making pcb installations be relocatable.  By this I
	mean you can configure and install with ./configure --prefix=/original/path make make install mv
	/original/path /new/path and still have pcb work.  To make this work, the binary path is determined at runtime and all
	of the other paths are computed relative to this.  As part of this, go ahead and kill off the pcb wrapper script around
	pcb-bin.  That was leftover from Xaw days and wasn't really needed
	anymore.  As a side effect, the --program-prefix and
	--program-suffix configure options will probably work now.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* acinclude.m4, config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: add autoconf
	macros from
	http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/adl_compute_relative_paths.html and
	http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/adl_normalize_path.html and use them
	to find relative paths from $bindir (where the pcb binary gets
	installed) to the directories with the default font and the
	footprints.  This is the first step in making an installation be
	relocatable.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/main.c: - Instead of tying the saving of preferences to the autobackup
	timer, save them when we press ok on the preferences form.  - Move the autosave code out of the gtk hid and put it in the core.
	  Now autosave should work on all gui's instead of just the gtk one.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Add a "find" and "rip-up" button
	to the netlist window.  Patch from Hans Nieuwenhuis on the geda-user
	mailing list.

2007-02-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h, src/file.c: Instead of writing the backup file
	always to /tmp/something derive a backup name from the pcb file name
	(if the pcb file name exists, otherwise use PCB.%i.save in the
	current directory).  This should make it easier to find the backup
	file for a particular layout and also helps in cases where /tmp is
	not appropriate (windows).

2007-02-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/main.c: Add command line option for setting DrawGrid

2007-02-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2007-01-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Fix a problem where we ended up
	with "//" in a full path name.  This caused problems on cygwin.

2007-01-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: add some code showing how to get the
	installation path on windows.  Right now, just print out the
	directory to show it works until I figure out how to get it to the
	rest of the program.

2007-01-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: clean out the old install directory prior to
	installing to avoid leftover cruft showing up in the installer.

2007-01-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* win32/build_pcb: add a number of flags to this script to help when
	using it with cvs sources or in debug mode.  See "build_pcb --help"
	for details on the flags.

2007-01-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, src/main.c: Break apart PCBTREEDIR into
	the original plus PCBTREEPATH where the latter is a : seperated path
	and the former is just the base installation directory for newlib.

2007-01-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/compat.c, src/compat.h, src/hid/common/hidinit.c: Add
	replacement wrappers for dlopen() and friends on windows.  Update
	the hid initialization code to pull in the compat header.  Also work
	around windows limitations with stat().  No change on real operating
	systems.

2007-01-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac: - check for dlfcn.h and windows.h - fix the test for if the PNG hid is being compiled in or not

2007-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: exclude .html and .png files from newlib directories

2007-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, src/pcbtest.sh.in: add the generated
	(from m4lib) newlib to the library search path

2007-01-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in, lib/footprint.pcb: - Add missing template .pcb file for generating previews of all the
	  footprints.  Building the previews also verifies that there are no
	  syntax errors in the m4lib footprints.  - fix the logic for rebuilding the newlib library from m4 libs.

2007-01-16   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Use a global aperture list instead of
	per-layer lists.

2007-01-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in: Build and install a newlib
	library from the m4lib library.  Currently nothing else has changed,
	the default for pcb is still the old behaviour.  This is just the
	first step.

2007-01-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: Make building the png preview optional.
	Other minor cleanups.

2007-01-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/djopt.c: Keep canonicalizing lines until they're all
	canonicalized.  Don't delete vias that aren't tented (assume they're
	test points).  Add an option to just canonicalize lines.

2007-01-14   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c, src/mtspace.c, src/mtspace.h: More thurough via
	site searching, cost function changes and some better handling of
	certain search conditions.  Much improved smoothing pass
	implementation. Doesn't gratuitously pack traces at minimum
	clearance during smoothing pass. Overall much better routing is
	acheived.

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Fix a bug in
	GTK hid that causes the view port to scroll in a random direction on
	a mouse click inside the view port (for example when drawing a
	line).  This bug only shows itself when an X application that steals window
	focus is running together with PCB on the same X server. At least
	GNOME and XFCE window managers are known to do that.  See the following and related GNOME bugs for some discussion about
	this: http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102209 See also GTK documentation for GtkWidget and GdkEvent.  Analysis and patch provided in patch [ 1610717 ] Patch for auto-pan
	bug by Tomaz Solc.  This should also address bug report [ 1593578 ] Display sometimes
	auto-scrolls when drawing lines by Garth Webb.

2006-12-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Intercept window manager delete
	events.  This prevents data loss when the window manager closes or
	deletes a window.   Reported as [ 1458340 ] data loss with closing
	main PCB windows and also on geda-dev by Peter Clifton.

2006-12-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-library-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-log-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-pinout-window.c: 
	Stop preventing the library, log, netlist, and pinout windows from
	accepting focus.  Preventing them from accepting focus had the side
	effect of breaking those dialogs on some systems with certain window
	managers.

2006-12-05   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: allow searching across expansion boxes in each

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-12-05   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Various changes to improve the ability to find

2006-12-03   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/misc.c, src/polygon.c: use Data->LayerN instead of max_layer

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-12-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/move.c: Handle edge conditions when adding/removing layers wrt

2006-12-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/move.c: Move thermals when we move layers.

2006-12-02   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Move layer ID text outside of the "board" area.
	Print board name, layer name, and mirror flag in lower left near
	margin.  When both mirror and auto-mirror are checked, xor them.

2006-12-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lpr/lpr.c, src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/hid/ps/ps.h: make sure the
	postscript header line makes it in the lpr HID.  Should fix problems
	where the postscript text was being printed instead of executed.

2006-11-16   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h, src/thermal.c: make clearances
	around rectangular pins and pads have rounded rectangle features

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-15   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/draw.c: remove dead code accidentally left behind

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-14   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/draw.c, src/polygon.c, src/polygon.h: always draw with dicing
	so that polygons can reside in holes of other polygons

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-14   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Make the invalidate

	drawing when zoomed in on a complex deisgn.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-13   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/buffer.c: Warn if non-manhattan lines are trying to become
	pads.

2006-11-13   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: preven silk clipping copper polygons and copper
	clipping silk polygons

2006-11-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/parse_y.y: minor fix to the FileVersion documentation

2006-11-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: add us and international business card media

2006-11-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/file.h, src/parse_l.l, src/parse_y.y: Add code to
	the parser which looks for a line like FileVersion[20061101] at the top of the .pcb file.  If this line is seen and indicates a
	version which is too new for this version of pcb then issue a
	complaint and explain why.  This should help out when the file
	format changes and someone tries to load a new design with an older
	version of pcb.  Of course the real benefit won't happen until
	versions of pcb prior to this check all go away...  For now, the actual output file from pcb hasn't changed.  There is a
	two line change to include the FileVersion[] line that can be
	included the next time the file format is changed.  However, there
	is no reason to not have the program start watching for it.

2006-11-10   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/buffer.c, src/undo.c: fix some segfaults due to clearing pcb
	pointer in data structure.

2006-11-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add several more media types and for the existing
	metric ones, recompute the bounding box size since pcb has more
	internal resolution that the old values.

2006-11-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/remove.c: prevent segfault when removing polyogn points
	resulting in fewer than 3 points in the poly

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-06   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c, src/polygon1.c: fix some bugs for unusual clipping
	conditions. Specifically holes touching at one point (or edge) as an
	acceptable self-intersection and snap-rounding expanding the
	bounding box by 1.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/pcbfile.texi: regen

2006-11-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/change.c, src/change.h, src/const.h,
	src/draw.c, src/find.c, src/strflags.c: Add a 'nopaste' flag for
	pads.  This lets you produce fiducial marks that should not have
	solder paste.  In addition you can use it for things like card edge
	connectors where you may not want solder paste.  Since this is
	moderately dangerous (how do you make sure you don't set this flag
	somewhere where you _need_ solder paste), the drc check reports a
	count of how many times this flag is used.

2006-11-04   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/intersect.c: fix crash due to not checking for no overlaps.
	Thanks to Anread Kemnade for the patch.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-11-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: use *FILEVERSION* instead of *VERSION* for the

	version and program version.

2006-10-29   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-21   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/parse_y.y, src/polygon.c: Avoid use of 'max_layer' macro - it

	reading.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-21   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	they want.

2006-10-20   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: check the coming regions, not the one we're at over
	and over

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-misc.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: add a
	couple of casts and kill the rest of the remaining gcc and SunPRO
	warnings!

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c, src/hid/lesstif/menu.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: cast to a size_t before converting

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-icons-misc.data, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c:

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: catch HID_Mixed in a switch

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/bom/bom.c, src/hid/gerber/gerber.c, src/print.c: avoid gcc
	warnings when using %c with strftime

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: #ifdef DEBUG out a couple of things which are
	defined but not used unless DEBUG is defined

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/draw.c: cast to a size_t before an int when passing an int to

2006-10-19   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: even faster tree searching and insertion

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: modify the DEBUGP macro slightly so it can be
	legally called with only one argument like DEBUGP("\n");

2006-10-19   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: oops, don't manage the contour bounding boxes in

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2006-10-18   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon1.c: speed up hole insertion further. Trees everywhere!

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-10-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: Only apply the -rdynamic check if we're
	using gcc.  This probably isn't the correct long term fix but for
	now it lets users with SunPRO build again.  The problem is -rdynamic
	with SunPRO's cc doesn't have the same behaviour as with gcc but it
	returns 0 so configure thinks it is ok to add -rdynamic.

2006-10-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Use the media option to set the page size and

2006-09-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, win32/build_pcb: Move the gcc flags that
	cause builds under cygwin to produce non-cygwin binaries out of the

	Strauss.

2006-09-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/extract-docs: make this script more robust with respect to the
	formatting of the help and syntax strings.  In particular, variable
	whitespace is now allowed in the "static const char" declaration and
	the string may not begin on the same line as the declaration.  This
	allows the source code to run through indent(1) and still have the
	docs extracted properly.

2006-09-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: We don't directly need X stuff anymore

	it can be used by other HID's.

2006-09-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/flags.c: A layer group containing only an "outline"
	or "route" layer will be named "outline" when exported.

2006-09-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: Add a --verbose option to list gerber
	files as they're printed.

2006-09-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rats.c: When optimizing rats, if there are > 0 of them,
	display a message indicating how many.  This way when the layout is
	not complete you see how far you have to go and also you see that
	the operation has done something.

2006-09-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/draw.c: If Settings.RatThickness is less than 20, it's a pixel
	size, not a pcb size.

2006-09-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: Display remaining rats in status bar.

	Break out layer->filename code.  Fix bug in top/bottom detection.

2006-09-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gerber/gerber.c: If the output file(s) can't be opened for
	writing then spit out an error message instead of segfaulting.  The
	segfaults were noted in bug [ 1556894 ] "segfault when exporting to
	non-existing directory" reported by Stephan Boettcher.

	provided by Peter Clifton.

2006-09-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/to.inc: remove a ' in an output comment line which threw off a
	closing ) that broke the TO3_90 element.

2006-09-13   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/common/actions.c:  * pcjc2 AT cam dot ac dot uk * Patch to

	* configure, configure.ac, lib/Makefile.am, lib/Makefile.in,
	lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: Go ahead and let configure process the
	m4lib_to_newlib script.  Also remove a couple of hardcoded paths in
	the same script.

2006-09-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/to.inc: Fix up the pads and drill sizes on the TO* packages.
	Based on patch [ 1108881 ] "Fix to m4 library hole sizes" by Walter
	Fetter Lages.  I added comments containing the actual dimensions
	from the JEDEC drawings and comments about how the pad size and
	drill size were selected.  Based on the JEDEC drawings I adjusted
	some of the drill and pad sizes.  I did not change or examine pin
	locations, numbering, or silk.

2006-09-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: improve the drill sizes for several footprints.
	Changes provided by patch [ 1108881 ] "Fix to m4 library hole sizes"
	by Walter Fetter Lages.

2006-09-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/common/hidinit.c: ensure that derive_default_filename()
	always comes back with a valid string even when we don't have a name
	for the pcbfile.  This fixes bug [ 1548756 ] "Segfault when
	exporting png files" reported by Werner Hoch.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/connector.inc: increase PKG_CONNECTOR and PKG_CONNECTOR_DIL
	hole size to something more reasonable.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: - remove the BRE* footprints.  The required PKG_RECTANGULAR macro
	  doesn't exist anywhere and I can't figure out what the correct
	  behaviour should be anyway so rather than propagate a very
	  questionable footprint name, kill it right here.  - Fix the problem where the ACY*P and RCY*P packages called
	  non-existant macros.  They now produce the same footprints as the
	  ACY* and RCY* packages but with a polarity marking.  The suitability
	  for any particular part number should be still verified before using
	them on a board.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/misc.inc: expand the PKG_AXIAL_LAY and PKG_RADIAL_CAN macros
	to take an extra optional argument.  When set to 1, this optional
	argument causes the part to have a "+" by pin 1 and "-" by pin 2.
	This was done instead of implementing the missing
	PKG_AXIAL_LAY_POLAR and  PKG_RADIAL_CAN_POLAR macros.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: Rather than putting a huge list of
	footprints into one index file, break it out by library.

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: remove unused PKG_DUMMY which did not do anything
	anyway

2006-09-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/m4lib_to_newlib.sh.in: - put both the index.html file and the broken.html file in the
	output directory.  - run pcb-bin from the src build directory to avoid complaints about
	  not being able to find the font - use .fp as the file extension for footprints - fix up the .png output file names - fix up the links in the index file

2006-09-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

2006-08-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/global.h, src/undo.c, src/undo.h: add a
	Renumber() action which renumbers reference designators and outputs
	a "was/is" sort of file which can be used for back annotation if
	someone writes a utility to apply those changes to a schematic.  For now Renumber() is still considered somewhat experimental and
	hence is not hooked up to the menus yet.

2006-08-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* configure, configure.ac: Add X_CFLAGS to CFLAGS so that Xm/Xm.h
	can be found.

2006-08-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: add header for a missing prototype

2006-08-15   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: Apply patch from patch [ 1496742 ] Make 'a' key
	(SetSame) work again submitted by Wim Lewis.

2006-08-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: when pkg-config fails to find the desired
	version of gtk or glib, then print the pkg-config output as part of
	the error message.  Suggested in bug # 1507555 by Mark Whitis.

2006-08-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: use 0.01 mm instead of 0.05 mm for the roundoff for
	01005 footprints because they are so small.  This bumps the gap
	between pads just over 6 mils instead of just under 6 mils.

2006-08-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lpr/lpr.c: Fix bug [ 1534098 ] Segmentation fault in GTK
	print dialog reported by Mark Rages.  Symptom was changing the lpr
	command in the gtk dialog box gave an instant crash.

2006-08-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: add hid/batch/batch_lists.h to
	DISTCLEANFILES

2006-08-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: Add 01005 footprints.

2006-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/copy.c: Remove extra calls to Draw().  This greatly speeds up
	copy operations.  This is especially true when pasting large blocks
	of layout.  Patch supplied by  Tibor Palinkas as patch #1532922.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/fontmode.c: Add font editing
	mode (FontEdit() and FontSave())

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/file.c: Use the old style (mil) syntax when saving font info,
	if the values permit it, for readability and to save file space.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c: Allow New() to take a name, so that the user need
	not be prompted during scripts and such.

2006-08-03   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/move.c: When deleting a layer, make sure to zero out the
	now-unused slot at the end.

2006-08-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: After running PATH_XTRA and checking for
	various X libs (Xpm, etc), we need to use $X_LIBS as part of LIBS in
	subsequent library tests or we'll have a failure.  This should
	address some issues noted recently on one of the gEDA lists and
	configuring with lesstif and the png HID's.

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c, src/print.c, src/print.h: When the drill list

2006-07-23   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: use "top" and "bottom" to describe the

	(bom, gerber, png, eps, ps).  The png code had one feature (last_made_filename) that was missing
	in the others.  This refactoring brings all the HIDs to feature
	parity, which lets pcb -x bom --bomfile=foo.txt bar.pcb work as expected.  The old code ignores the command line flag, and
	writes the bom to bar.bom.  Likewise for .xy, .gbr, .eps, and .ps
	files.  Also fixes a couple of spelling errors.

2006-04-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* ChangeLog: update for 20060422 snapshot

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Comment out locale.h since the code

	with sunpro and the gtk HID.

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/macro.h: protect some GNU C specific stuff with #ifdef
	__GNUC__

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c: change from NONE_PRESSED to
	NO_BUTTON_PRESSED since the former is not part of the ButtonState
	enum while the latter is.

2006-04-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: comment out with #if 0 the code related to
	lesstif_options and lesstif_resources since those were both empty.
	With this change pcb should build correctly on 64-bit Irix-6.5 with
	version 7.41 of the MIPSpro compilers.  There are still a handful of
	compiler warnings to investigate.

2006-04-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	lesstif hid actions.

2006-04-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/box.h, src/find.c: rely on the autoconf test for inline
	instead of using our own based on __GNUC__.  This will let other
	non-gcc C99 compilers take advantage of inline.

2006-04-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, doc/actions.texi,

	compiler.  - move the X11 includes into a header where they can be included in
	  a way which keeps them from messing up the namespace of the rest of   pcb.  Fixes some obscure warnings from sunpro.

2006-04-19   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: get this to properly link when --disable-gif is
	used and the installed libgd does not have gif support.

2006-04-19   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/ps/ps.c: Add --psfade option.

	doc/pcbfile.texi, doc/version.texi, src/const.h, src/hid.h,
	src/hid/common/actions.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c, src/parse_y.y: 
	Remove all the prev-next-up links, reformat all the texi files to
	allow for automatic structure generation.  Add helper hooks in the
	extractor to let the source files control what types of nodes and
	document structure is used for each category.  Auto-create nodes and
	document substructure for each key within each category.

2006-04-17   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: For the Gtk HID, add an

	src/hid/gtk/gui-log-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Fix soldermask draw
	while TAB view from solder side.  Don't raise windows if already shown so library & netlist window
	won't grab focus.  Focus can still be grabbed if an already shown
	window is reshown via the top menu bar.  Not sure yet how to handle
	this case.

2006-04-16   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: switch the output scaling to default to 100 dpi
	instead of fixing the max dimension at 800 pixels.  This at makes
	the default be a sort of to scale (for 100 dpi monitors it will be
	to scale) image.

2006-04-15   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Support --bg-image in the Gtk HID.  Images can be
	jpg, png, gif, etc. as supported by the Gdk installation.  Zooming gets slow at higher zoom levels, but I can address that
	later when I have more time.

2006-04-14   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/global.h: Make sure the Message and return are in the same
	scope.

	* doc/thermal.pcb: add a drawing showing what a thermal relief looks
	like

2006-04-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/database.txt, doc/ideas/database.txt, doc/ideas/keepouts.txt,
	doc/keepouts.txt: move these to an ideas subdirectory to hopefully
	more clearly indicate that not only are these not implemented yet
	but that they are not even certain to ever be implemented.

2006-04-12   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi, src/netlist.c: Document
	actions in netlist.c

2006-04-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, src/action.c: add support for units and relative
	coordinates in PasteBuffer(ToLayout)

2006-04-12   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/database.txt, doc/keepouts.txt: add two documents in progress
	describing a plan for future work

2006-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, src/action.c, src/global.h: Add a "ToLayout"
	option for the PasteBuffer() action.  You can now do things like
	PasteBuffer(ToLayout, 10000, 200000) to paste from the current
	buffer Also add a DumpLibrary() action.

2006-04-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	lib/generic.m4, lib/resistor_0.25W.list, lib/resistor_array.list,
	lib/texas_inst_voltage_reg.m4, lib/transistor.m4: - add a missing description and move some footprints from the wrong
	.list file to the correct .list file to be able to pick up the
	descriptions and parameters from the corresponding .m4 file.  - all of the m4 libs should at least be correct in the sense that
	the pieces are all there and they all run through m4 correctly.
	They have not been verified any more for correctness, but this is
	progress.

2006-04-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/print.c, src/report.c: Print correct symbol counts for drills
	on fab drawing.

	src/select.h: - for the Select(*ByName) action, allow a 2nd argument to specify
	the name and only use the gui dialog box if the 2nd argument is not
	specified.  - Add *ByName options for the Unselect() action.

2006-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: garbage collect some printf output

2006-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix bug [ 1462380 ] saving buffer
	elemnts to file does nothing.

2006-04-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: When
	building docs, look for a perl to use.  This will let the user set
	PERL in their environment and have configure pick it up.

2006-04-11   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/find.c: turn off debugging by default

2006-04-10   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/version.texi, src/action.c: Document the
	rest of the registered actions in action.c.

2006-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	get missed

2006-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: declare dump_actions() right before using it

2006-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/png/png.c: add some missing const-s

2006-04-06   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: mode_button_toggled_cb() didn't sync
	ghidgui->settings_mode with current mode button state.

2006-04-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: revert the previous, this part
	wasn't quite right.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/mymem.c, src/mymem.h: add a MyMalloc to go along with MyCalloc

2006-04-05   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: - make the ESC key return you to the arrow tool if you are in via,
	  thermal, lock, etc modes.  - in line, poly, arc, etc. modes, the first ESC press returns you to
	  "tool neutral" and the 2nd ESC press returns you to the arrow tool.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog.c, src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: add pointer
	to the geda homepage and wiki as well as the pcb home page in the
	about dialog

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-dialog-print.c: fix a bug which prevented the
	File->Export menu from working more than once in a pcb session.

2006-04-05   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/djopt.c, src/hid.h, src/hid/common/actions.c,
	src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/main.c, src/main.c, src/vendor.c: Initial chunk of
	inline action docs.

2006-04-05   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in, doc/actions.texi,
	doc/extract-docs, doc/pcb.texi, doc/version.texi: Fix eps->pdf rule
	to set size and resolution right.  Limit pcb->* to visible areas.
	Add support for action extraction from sources.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in,
	src/script/pcb-print: remove the pcb-print script.  It is obsolete
	now that the HID version directly supports command line export/print
	through the export HID's.

2006-04-05   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/find.c: Expand search box during bloat in case the box overlap
	would otherwise prevent checking.  This repairs a really bad bug
	introduced when the rtrees were used to speed the find tracing.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-04-05   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/misc.c: fixed pin/via bounding box to include thermal tails;
	bug reported by CL

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui.h: Be a bit more careful with rouding issues when
	converting to pcb units.  Hopefully this will help with the issue
	reported on the geda lists about 23.99 mil vias when the user
	thought they picked 24 mil ones.  Patch posted on geda-user by DJ.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, src/hid/png/png.c: check to
	see which graphic file formats are supported by the installed GD.
	If the desired list is not found, abort and tell the user they can
	explicitly disable certain file types.  Should deal with installed
	versions of gd which do not support GIF output.

2006-04-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: fix a prototype

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dolists.h, src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c, src/hid/lesstif/main.c,
	src/hid/lesstif/menu.c, src/hid/lesstif/styles.c: move variable
	declarations to the beginning of blocks to make gcc-2.95 and
	probably other non-gcc compilers happy.

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: Check to make sure a pointer is not NULL before
	dereferencing it.  This seems to be the place where the segfault was
	happening sometimes when saving connection data.  For now, spit out
	a warning message because I think there may be some other underlying
	bug which causes the NULL pointer in the first place.

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/mymem.h: do not redefine malloc if we are using dmalloc

	pointers are different sizes.

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: access djopt_set_auto_only() via the
	associated action instead of directly

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/djopt.c, src/djopt.h: fix prototype for an action.  kills one
	more compiler warning

2006-03-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: add a missing typecase

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/pcb-menu.res: - When changing selected line size from the menu, do it to the
	selected arcs to.  - Add a SelectedArcs option to the ChangeSize action.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/select.c: Fix a bug where actions using SelectedPads did
	nothing and SelectedPins picked up both pins and pads.  Noted by bug
	#1438523

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/strflags.c: avoid allocating 0 bytes

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: fix a typo in a comment

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: No need to use strdup(Concat()) as Concat already
	gives us allocated memory that is not referenced anywhere else.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: Fix an off by one overflow of a malloc'ed buffer.
	Found with ElectricFence.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: in a function which is supposed to return a string but
	is commented out with #ifdef FIXME, return a big warning string
	rather than no return value until I/we figure out how to fix it.
	Hopefully if this triggers bugs it will be easier to locate.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: add back in the --enable-efence and
	--enable-dmalloc configure flags to turn on ElectricFence and
	dmalloc debugging respectively.

2006-03-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-utils.c: Make sure
	we initialize some variables before using them.  Fixes a segfault on
	startup problem noted on NetBSD/alpha when displaying to an 8-bit
	Xvnc.

2006-03-27   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: I wrapped too much into the verbose
	option so the file load stopped working - fixed.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: bump the rev letter to help identify this
	as the HID version if someone pulls up the "about" dialog box.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: - Remove a debug printf which tried to print a NULL string.  Avoids
	a segfault bug.  - When chosing "Save Layout" on a new layout (that hadn't already
	been given a name or filename), correctly use the new file name that
	is selected with the dialog box.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/dialogs.c: - remove a debug printf which was trying to print a NULL string.
	  Fixes a segfault bug on solaris-2.9/sparc.  - Fix the behaviour when doing "Save Layout" on a new board that   didn't have a file name yet.

2006-03-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/lesstif/main.c: add a --listen option for the lesstif HID
	too (works the same as the gtk one -- listens on stdin for actions).

2006-03-26   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-output-events.c: 
	Pan to a netlist window selected node if it's not visible.  Fix a pan bug.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: add cast to avoid compiler
	warnings

2006-03-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c, src/pcb-menu.res: Add
	File->Revert.

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c, src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Turn
	of Disable all nets button when NetlistChanged.  Make some diagnostic output only if verbose.

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-netlist-window.c: Set netlist nodes enabled by
	default when NetlistChanged.

2006-03-25   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gtkhid-main.c: Fix draw arc when flipped.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/actions.texi, doc/fractional_size.texi, doc/letter_size.texi,
	doc/metric_size.texi, doc/overview.texi, doc/pcbfile.texi,
	doc/wire_size.texi: add some of the generated files to see if that
	will help with those who don't read the README.cvs file...

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: use fileno(stdin) instead of 1 to
	get the stdin file descriptor.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/drill.c: fix a segfault when printing a board with no drill
	holes at all.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: add a --listen option which causes
	pcb to listen on the standard input for actions.  This should open
	the door to experimenting with having gschem interact directly with
	pcb.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-config.c: Fix a bug in options parsing where the
	loop looking for matches continued after a match had already been
	found.

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: add a help string for --lib-newlib

2006-03-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: minor cleanup of status output

2006-03-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/hid/lesstif/menu.c: Also look for ~/.pcb/pcb-menu.res.
	Actually use the path we found ;-)

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac: List the available HID's in the
	./configure --help output.  Ideally, we'd have the help text be
	automatic, but until we figure out how, just statically list the HID
	(in the help text)

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.am, README.cvs, configure.ac, doc/Makefile.am: - when not in maintainer mode, do not list all the dependencies for
	  the manual.  This allows regular users who are building from a
	  tarball to avoid having to rebuild the manual and lets them simply
	  take the preformatted one.  This avoids recently noted issues with
	  incompatibility with older versions of texinfo which seem somewhat
	  common.  It also removes the requirement for having latex installed
	  and for building the png HID for pcb.  - add a --disable-doc flag which allows users who are building from
	  CVS to skip the doc directory and thus avoid the need for the
	  documentation formatting tools.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.snapshots: note the DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS variable

2006-03-24   Bill Wilson * billw2 AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/hid/gtk/gui-top-window.c: Fix gtk magenta color messages ->
	initialize all new hidGC colornames to Settings.BackgroundColor
	because bgGC color outside of ghid_expose_callback() is never
	initialized and it's used to draw outside of the callback when an
	object is selected.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	things a bit when trying to have several different builds share the
	same source tree.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/extract-docs: put the generated files in the build directory
	instead of the source directory (in case they are not the same)

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in: Rework the dependencies on the
	various generated files a bit to hopefully correctly include all
	dependencies.  Also allow this to continue and just use the shipped
	preformatted docs in the case where latex and friends are not
	available.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in: correctly find the font file correctly find the
	m4lib stuff when building outside the source tree.

2006-03-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure, configure.ac, lib/ListLibraryContents.sh,
	lib/ListLibraryContents.sh.in: move ListLibraryContents.sh to being

	* lib/QueryLibrary.sh.in, lib/common.m4: add an optional -fp
	argument which will display the correct footprint= attribute for
	gschem.  Generally useful for debugging.

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/pci.inc, lib/pci.list, lib/pci.m4: Remove the abuse of the
	value field as a way of passing in multiple extra parameters.  While
	here fix the pinlists.  These footprints still have diagonal pads
	which are not allowed.

2006-03-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am, lib/genericsmt.inc, lib/genericsmt.list,
	lib/genericsmt.m4: garbage collect some footprints that were not at
	all conforming to the correct usage of the m4 library system.  In
	addition, they were rather redundant.

2006-03-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/CreateLibraryContents.sh.in: put the correct gschem footprint=
	attribute in [] at the end of each description

2006-03-11   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/change.c, src/change.h: Add "join" to SetFlag,
	ClrFlag, and ChangeFlag actions.

2006-03-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Fixed bug where pads were assumed to be on the
	same side as the element

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-03-08   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/crosshair.c: Crosshair snap to pad ends instead of center -
	necessary for rat drawing because rats only connect at pad end
	points.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-03-06   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/print.c: Fab author fixes from Karel.

2006-03-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/parse_y.y: Fix reduce-reduce conflicts (patch from DJ).

2006-03-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: - clarify that the manual does not currently document the very
	  latest pcb output file format.  - add a (sparsely populated) glossary appendix - add a note about how to change layers

2006-03-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h, src/action.c, src/create.c, src/file.c,
	src/find.c, src/global.h, src/gui-config.c, src/parse_y.y,
	src/rotate.c, src/sizedialog.c, src/vendor.c: add DRC checks for
	minimum drill diameter and minimum annular ring.

2006-03-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rats.c: When manually adding nets, make sure we actually pick
	a unique name when a new net is created.  Fixes a bug noted by
	Vanessa Dannenberg.

2006-02-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pad.pcb: Add a pad drawing showing how a pad is drawn with a
	rectangular aperture.  Not used yet, but this will replace the tgif
	drawing at some point.

2006-01-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/error.c: apply some fixes for DragonFly BSD

2006-01-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: format cleanup of ActionChangePinName() to bring
	more in line with GNU coding standards for C code formatting.

2006-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: document ChangePinName action

2006-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/command.c: add a ChangePinName()
	action which lets you change the name of a pin/pad on an element.
	For example, ChangePinName(U1, 7, VCC) changes the name of pin #7 on
	U1 to "VCC".  This makes it simple to propagate pin names from a
	schematic capture tool to the layout without requiring the layout
	library to know the pin names for every component.

	handling

2006-01-15   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/polygon.c: Fixed bugs in GetClosestPolygonPoint where (a) the
	passed point was not used, and (b) projection of the segment past
	the end was being used when it shouldn't.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: Speed computation of route costs, it uses about
	13% of the CPU time during routing.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/rtree.c: Speed up the rtree searches by establishing better
	balance of the cluster size during a node split. This reduces the
	tree depth resulting in faster searching.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/strflags.c: Fixed clearline flag so that arcs also have this
	property

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-01-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/change.c: Fixed bug where clearances could be set 1 below the

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.in: regen [put the html manual in 1 file]

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am: put the html manual in 1 file.  Its a bit easier
	to manage

2005-12-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/version.texi: bump date last touched

2005-12-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: cause the missing ) in PKG_SMT_2PAD_MM100 to appear

2005-12-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: - added the pad drawing showing how a pad is drawn with an aperture.  - added some comments about the evolving file format for layout
	files.

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c, src/global.h, src/gui-netlist-window.c, src/rats.c: 
	fix a bug which prevented disabling nets from the ratsnest

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: fix duplicate PKG_SME4 which should have been called
	 SME5.  Reported by Wojciech Kazubski in bug #1353304

2005-12-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in: Be sure to set the library path to the source
	tree.  Patch supplied by Wim Lewis in patch #1362564

2005-10-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: redo the 0201, 0402, etc passives to bring them in
	line with the IPC recommendations.  The pads on, for example 0603,
	were too small before.  They worked, were really not adequate.

2005-10-11   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: add a PKG_SMT_2PAD_MM100 which directly takes
	dimensions for the pads, silk, and placement courtyard from IPC-7351
	for things like 0402 capacitor and resistor footprints.

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* autogen.sh: make this script a bit more verbose and also abort on
	errors

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2005-09-06   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: make sure to check for -lX11 even when we're using
	the gtk gui.  action.c still has a direct call to an X function
	(XWarpPointer) so on some systems (Solaris) you need to explicitly
	link -lX11 instead of getting it through the gtk dependencies

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: check for gtk+ >= 2.4.0 instead of 2.2.0 since we
	need >= 2.4.0

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in: add pcb-print to
	the list of distributed files

2005-08-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/pcb-print: fix a bug in the --add-alignment option.
	Noted by David Baird

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gui-library-window.c: fix -auto-place for the library window

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/script/pcb-print: add script to make it easier to print from
	the command line

2005-08-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/command.c, src/global.h,
	src/gui-library-window.c, src/gui-log-window.c,
	src/gui-netlist-window.c, src/gui-pinout-window.c,
	src/gui-top-window.c, src/main.c, src/misc.c,
	src/script/Makefile.am, src/script/Makefile.in: - change the Print action to PrintDialog since it causes the print   dialog box to come up - add a new Print action provided by David Baird as patch # 1212168.    Modified by me to work with the gtk version of pcb.  - to let this action work, allow actions to take a parameter list
	  and # of parameters to allow large numbers of arguments.  - modify the Quit action and some of the initialization code so that   you can use Quit() in a startup script.  - add a -auto-place command line option which causes the windows to
	  be automatically placed rather than letting the window manager do
	  it.  This is useful when printing via the command line.  - add a command line shell script for printing.  This is a wrapper
	  which takes a whole bunch of flags relating to the print parameters
	  and translates that to the correct invocation of the Print() action.    Shell script provided by David Baird as part of patch #1212168 and   modified by me to make it portable.

2005-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add 1008 package

2005-07-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/bourns.inc: fix the pin order.

2005-07-24   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/gui-config.c: Fix initial layer groups so that layer named
	'component' is actually on the component side and layer named
	'solder' is actually on the solder side. Unfortunately the GTK
	version saves the old bug in the .pcb/preferences file so no
	patching will fix existing installations. They must manually edit
	the layer groups and check the "use as default" to fix their
	installation.

	----------------------------------------------------------------------

2005-07-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* aclocal.m4, configure: regen (fix botched commit which was missing
	some M4 paths)

2005-07-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi, doc/version.texi: add appendix describing the
	centroid file format along with the algorithm for finding the
	centroid and rotation.

2005-07-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/print.c: remove some redundant code to make things more clear

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/genericsmt.m4: fix typo

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* aclocal.m4, configure: regen

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac, src/vendor.c: add a check for sys/types.h and then
	if found, include in vendor.c.  Needed to build on FreeBSD.  Problem
	and fix reported in bug #1220963.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/qfn.inc: hires-ify the QFN packages.  While here make sure we
	use an appropriate soldermask relief for this style of package.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/gui-dialog-print.c, src/gui-dialog-size.c, src/set.c: remove
	the inclusion of menu.h.  We don't use that file anymore and the
	only reason we could still build on some systems is we'd find the
	/usr/include/menu.h from curses!  Problem noted in bug #1226924 by
	Axeloide.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/refcard.tex, src/gui-keyref-window.c, src/gui-output-events.c: 
	apply patches provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1230708.   Fix key bindings for drill size changes to be <mod>s  and <shift><mod>s to agree with the Xaw default key  bindings.   Add missing key bindings '/' and '.' for cycle  multiline mode and toggle 45 degree enforcement  respectively.   Fix refcard.tex to reflect the current set of key binding.   Now the gtk key bindings and the refcard should be in  sync and be the same as the default Xaw PCB bindings  with one exception: the buffer selection binding is  <control>1...5 instead of <shift>1...5. This can be  fixed but at the cost of removing the shortcuts from  the menus because gtk can't use <shift>digits as menu  shortcuts.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* INSTALL, NEWS, README-GTK_PORT: apply patches provided by Bill
	Wilson in patch #1230704  This patch adds a note to the README-GTK_PORT about  runtime warnings if using early gtk+2.4.0 versions.   It also makes small adjustments to the INSTALL file to  remove an outdated Xt reference and a non-existent  68HC11 file reference.   In addition, note that gtk+2.4 is needed, not gtk+2.2.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/global.h, src/gui-config.c, src/gui-top-window.c, src/gui.h: 
	apply patches provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1227292  As per a request on the gEDA list, this patch adds a  Preferences option to make the layout name appear on  the window title bar instead of on the main menu bar  area. This is convenient when the layout name might be  somewhat long and takes up too much horizontal space on  the menu bar area.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/gui-config.c, src/gui-top-window.c: apply patches
	 provided by Bill Wilson in patch #1227205 When loading layouts using
	 alternating mil/mm units, the PCB units displaying can get out of
	 sync. This patch fixes it.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c, src/gui-utils.c: apply patches provided by Bill Wilson
	in patch #1215935 1) The DRC user interface issue has been reported on the gEDA
	mailing list and is listed on the PCB bugs page as request id
	1206762 dated 2005-05-23 01:29 and is fixed in this patch.  3) Fix a dangling DRC check g_message() which I overlooked fixing
	during the final Gtk port cleanup.  4) Adjust the DRC draw centering to be 1/4 screen offset since the
	continue dialog is centered (under window manager control) and that
	was covering up the DRC highlighted portion of the draw which was
	previously also centered.  2) The log window was not scrolling to keep most recent log items
	added in view and this patch fixes that.

2005-07-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/const.h, src/global.h, src/gui-netlist-window.c: apply the
	patches provided by Wim Lewis in patch #1189989 to allow pcb to
	compile more cleanly on OpenBSD.

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/Pcb.ad.in, src/main.c, src/set.c: - break the status line into 2 lines as it was getting rather long - put the cursor position line below the menu as it is also getting   rather long with the metric display.  Besides keeping the 2 lines from being cutoff on smaller displays,
	it seems to avoid some of the strange Xaw issues seen in bug
	#1099862 and patch #1042731 where the porthole for the main drawing
	area is not properly sized and where the status line is sometimes
	covered by the porthole.

	* src/Makefile.in: regen

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	source directory.

2005-01-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi, src/action.c, src/pcb-menu.res: Add "Selected" and

	disperse all of them.  Add corresponding menu choices.

2005-01-18   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2005-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c: use LAYOUT_BOTTOM to always put the status line at the
	bottom of the main window.  Gets rid of some annoying bugs on
	solaris and some other systems where the status line would sometimes
	get covered up when the window was resized.

2005-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/create.c: in the message log produced when a via size has to
	be increased to meet the minimum copper, add a location to make it
	easier to locate the via.

2005-01-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	refdes from being expanded by m4.  Lets you use "X1" as the refdes
	in gschem and gsch2pcb

	command line option

2004-08-27   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/global.h, src/main.c, src/misc.c, src/resmenu.c: add an
	ExecuteFile(file) action which executes the actions contained in the
	specified file.  In addition, add a "-script <filename>" option
	which will invoke ExecuteFile(<filename>) upon startup.  Eventually
	(but not yet) this will be able to be used for things like
	generating postscript and RS-274-X output from the command line.

2004-08-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resmenu.c: Fix a minor memory leak bug which allocated space
	for 10 more pointers everytime invoke_action() was called.  While here add a few comments about whats going on in this function.

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: update the table of the output files generated by
	PCB

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c: exclude Makefile, Makefile.am, and Makefile.in as
	valid element names as these may reside in a lib directory

	* src/action.c: add one more Usage message.  this time for the
	RemoveSelected() action

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/main.c, src/misc.c: allow --version, --help, and --copyright
	to also work since those are typically supported by GNU programs.

2004-08-25   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/misc.c: In the Usage() function be sure to restore stderr at
	the beginning since this function calls exit().  This will ensure
	that the Usage() message can actually be seen in all cases.  Fixes
	  the following:  clock AT oberon:~$ pcb --version    clock AT oberon:~$ noted by Karel Kulhav on the gEDA mailing
	list.

2004-08-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.in: regen after adding pcb.1

2004-08-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/pcb.1: add a man page which says where to
	look for the manual

2004-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: avoid 'inline' unless we're using gcc.

2004-07-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/res_parse.y: use foo?foo:bar instead of foo?:bar as the latter
	is a gcc extension.  Makes the irix c compiler happy.

2004-07-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: update the 150 and 300 mil width SOIC packages per
	the IPC recommendations at footprint.ipc.org.  Partially addresses
	the "silk on pad" bug noted in bug report #995401.

2004-07-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: improve the decision on adding or not adding a silk
	arc on the COMMON_SMT_DIL_MIL macro

2004-07-17   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/print.c: Only clear silk on same side as pad. Patch
	contributed by burto

2004-07-10   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* doc/pcb.texi, src/draw.c, src/draw.h, src/global.h, src/main.c,
	src/misc.c: Add limited support for a behind-the-board background
	image.

2004-07-08   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rubberband.c: Fix a bug related to checking for the
	intersection of a circular region defined by an line end point and
	its radius and a rectangular pin/pad.  The old code looked for the
	intersection of the smallest square which encloses the circular
	region and the rectangular pin/pad region.  However this method
	claims that there are intersections when in fact there are not.  For
	example a very wide trace has a significant area enclosed by the
	square which encloses the circular region defined by the line end
	and radius that is not enclosed by the circular region.  The new code actually looks for intersection of the circular region
	and the square region.

2004-07-07   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/rubberband.c: fix some errors where the diameter was used
	where the radius should have been used when looking for circular
	regions which intersect.  Fixes bug report #978412.  Partial patch
	provided in the bug report, additional bugs fixed by me.  Note: a bug still exists when calculating line -> rectangular pad
	intersection.  A fix will be coming.

2004-07-02   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/undo.c: Fix UndoChangeMaskSize assuming LINESTRUCT has the
	mask parameter

2004-06-30   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in, src/script/pcb.in: when running under gdb set
	XAPPLRESDIR and unset XUSERFILESEARCHPATH

2004-06-30   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/resmenu.c: make 'str' static so that the memory allocated by
	MyStrdup() can properly be freed on the next call of invoke_action.

2004-06-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: Change size of selected objects, fix enlarge
	options to actually enlarge (bug 978408)

2004-06-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/menu.c: Cut and Copy from the popup menu now wait for a click
	before acting (bug 978406)

2004-06-24   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Pcb.ad.in, src/main.c, src/menu.c, src/pcb-menu.res,
	src/resmenu.c, src/resmenu.h: Add support for menu accelerators.
	Replace hotkey translations with menu accelerators where
	appropriate.

2004-06-20   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in: Run gather-actions only if
	maintainer-mode

2004-06-15   Harry Eaton * haceaton AT users dot sourceforge dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/autoroute.c, src/const.h, src/menu.c,
	src/pcb-menu.res: Fix live routing menu handling; patch segfault on
	breaking element with no element specified.  Autorouter tweaks.

2004-06-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/geda.inc: add a few more 400mil width DIP packages (DIPxM)

2004-06-10   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dev_rs274x.c: make sure we define all aperture codes used by
	arcs.  Fixes the bug reported in bug #969903 by Werner Hoch where an
	arc of a width not used by anything else in the layout does not have
	its aperture defined.

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c: fix the function name strings passed to MyCalloc().

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: Do not arbitrarily change the zoom setting
	whenever running DRC.  Especially if there are no DRC errors, we
	don't want/need to change the zoom.  Noted by Mark Becker.

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: Add 0.5 and 0.1 mil grid selections.  Requested
	in RFE #876549 by John Griessen.

2004-06-09   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/find.c, src/misc.c, src/misc.h: Save layerstack settings prior
	to running DRC and restore them afterwards so that things like
	current input layer are not changed by DRC.  Noted by Mark Becker.

2004-06-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen after rpath flag order change

2004-06-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: change the order in the list of rpath flags which
	are tried out.  This is because when -R was tried first, it was
	accepted on linux systems because even though gcc didn't like it, it
	still exited with 0.  The new order seems to do the right thing on
	solaris, linux, and netbsd as the compiler now actually gives an
	error code for the flags it does not like.

2004-06-05   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/djopt.c: Be even more picky about which line is chosen as an
	example.

2004-06-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen (If --enable-dmalloc is given but dmalloc is not
	found then error out instead of disabling dmalloc

2004-06-04   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: If --enable-dmalloc is given but dmalloc is not
	found then error out instead of disabling dmalloc

2004-06-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: add usage output for several more actions

2004-06-03   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c: Add usage output if the input arguments are not
	quite right for several actions.  Still have more to add, but this
	is a start.

2004-06-02   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/default_font:  add @ character.  Absence noted by Dave
	McGuire.

2004-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcb-menu.res: add a GetXY() to the 'copy selection to buffer'
	menu.  Needed to have a resonable reference point for the copy.
	Noted by Mark Becker.

2004-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure: regen (fail configuration if Xaw is not found)

2004-06-01   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: fail configuration if Xaw is not found

	with versions on the next snapshot

2004-05-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* NEWS: remove duplicated line

2004-05-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* ChangeLog: update changelog with cvs2cl.pl.  This file previously
	was empty.

2004-05-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/version.texi: bump updated date to match snapshot date

2004-05-31   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* NEWS: add some release notes for the upcoming 20040530 snapshot

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/change.c: add missing prototype

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* globalconst.h: set MASKFRAME to be 3 (mils) instead of 0.  This
	way the soldermask opening will be larger than the pads for
	components defined using the older style format which did not
	explicitly give soldermask relief size.

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: document the SetFlag(), ClrFlag(), and ChangeFlag()
	actions

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/pcb.texi: correct location for Pcb appdefaults file

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/pcbtest.sh.in, src/script/pcb.in: For the pcb wrapper script,
	if the first argument is "-gdb", pick off that flag and run pcb
	inside of the gdb debugger.  Should simplify debugging a bit.

2004-05-29   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/action.h, src/change.c, src/change.h,
	src/main.c: Add SetFlag, ClrFlag, and ChangeFlag actions.  These
	currently let you set, clear, or change the square, octagon, or
	thermal pads.  For example :SetFlag(SelectedVias,thermal)
	:ClrFlag(SelectedObjects,square) :ChangeFlag(SelectedPads,octagon,1)

2004-05-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/djopt.c: Fix the segfault bug noted in bug report #959073 by
	Bob Paddock.  While here, also fix a bug which can potentially cause
	a floating point exception.

2004-05-28   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	submitted by Mike Frysinger

2004-05-23   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/smt.inc: update the COMMON_SMT_2PAD_MIL macro to the newer
	element format.  With this change, the soldermask relief and
	clearance can now be specified for the pads.  This fixes the issue
	noted recently on the geda mailing list about 0805 footprints from
	the ~geda library having soldermask openings which are the same size
	as the pads.

2004-05-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dev_ps.c: make sure we get the preamble in all EPS output
	files.  Bug noted by David Koski

	McGuire

2004-05-14   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	already took input arguments in 1/1000 mil so now we simple only
	reduce the resolution to 1/100 mil in the output instead of to 1
	mil.  This also helps the COMMON_SMT_DIL_MM which calls the
	COMMON_SMT_DIL_MIL macro.

	  place as noted in bug report 716519 and for centering a part on a
	grid.  - while here make sure the $1, $2, and $3 arguments to the various   macros are properly quoted.  This helps avoid some obscure bugs   with generated layouts from gEDA.

	case the aperture selection code is missing from the output file.  The second bug is when the first point drawn has its Y coordinate
	(in PCB coordinates) equal to zero.  The output will be at gerber Y
	coordinate zero which is on the opposite side of the board.  Thanks to Gabriel Paubert (paubert at iram dot es) for noting these

2003-07-01   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/sizedialog.c: The minimum size of a board should never be more
	than the current actual size of the board.

2003-06-25   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Pcb.ad.in, src/change.c: Automatically set CLEARLINEFLAG if
	the user modifies the clearance.  Add keys for changing clearance by
	selection instead of pointer.

2003-06-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Makefile.in: Regenerate with djopt.c

2003-06-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/action.c, src/const.h, src/crosshair.c, src/menu.c: Add
	orthogonal move feature

2003-06-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Pcb.ad.in, src/action.c, src/const.h, src/draw.c, src/menu.c: 
	Add Thindraw

2003-06-22   DJ Delorie * dj AT delorie dot com *

	* src/Makefile.am, src/Pcb.ad.in, src/djopt.c, src/djopt.h,
	src/main.c, src/menu.c: Add trace optimizer.

2003-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure, depcomp: add
	automake/conf output to make it easier for users to build

2003-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README_FILES/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in, example/Makefile.in,
	lib/Makefile.in, newlib/2_pin_thru-hole_packages/Makefile.in,
	newlib/Makefile.in, newlib/analog-devices/Makefile.in,

	the automake/conf generated files to make building from CVS sources
	easier for people.

2003-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/error.c: only declare sys_nerr if we're using the sys_errlist
	interface.  This fixes compilation on NetBSD/alpha using gcc-3.3.

2003-06-13   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/dev_rs274x.c: remove unused varargs.h header which breaks
	gcc-3.3 compilation

2003-06-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/action.c, src/menu.c: Allow '=' at the beginning of the zoom
	exponent to indicate an absolute number rather than a relative
	number.  This lets a value of "=-2" be used to indicate an absolute
	-2 while "-2" still indicates a relative -2.  Also correct the
	position of the check mark on the zoom menu.  Patch from DJ Delorie.

2003-05-26   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/file.c, src/fileselect.c, src/misc.c, src/misc.h: Fix a bug in
	the way the current working directory is found.  This caused the
	file dialog box to always start in the library tree directory.  In addition add a loop in ParseLibraryTree() to allow multiple
	newlib style directory tree's to be specified in the Xresource.
	This provides an easy way to have per-user and per-project library
	directories.  These directories may either be specified as an
	absolute or relative path.  Patches provided by Tony (droghedra at users dot sourceforge dot
	net) in bug report 736010 with minor changes by me.

2003-05-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/Makefile.am: add missing rules.inc

2003-05-22   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/menu.c: add 2 more levels of zooming to the menu.  Inspired by
	an email from DJ Delorie on the gEDA mailing list.

2003-05-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/parse_l.l: change yy_current_buffer to YY_CURRENT_BUFFER.
	This addresses the build \ problem reported in bug 734403 and also
	agrees with the man page for \ flex-2.5.4.\ \ In addition add a
	%option yylineno to address part of bug 736010\ where the line
	number associated with a parse error is incorrectly\ displayed as 1.
	\

2003-05-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* lib/common.m4: add missing bga.inc and resistor_adjust.inc
	included.  The latter addresses part of bug report 734403.

2003-03-17   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* : remove spurious file which should not have been imported.  Noted
	 by Mark Becker.

	* ...: remove spurious file which should not have been imported.
	Noted by Mark Becker.

2003-03-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/error.c: if strerror() is present on our system then use it
	instead of trying to use sys_errlist.  Patch from harry, with the
	check for strerror from me.

2003-03-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: move the strerror test up in the configure process
	so we don't need to link to the X libraries for the test.

2003-03-05   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: add check for strerror()

2003-02-24   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: when checking for a NULL pointer compare to NULL
	rather than 0 for enhanced portability.

2003-02-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* configure.ac: bump to 1.99o since a 1.99n version was posted to
	the geda list.  We should avoid further updates to this version
	number until a release.  If users want snapshots, they can get them
	from CVS.

2003-02-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/kdtree.c: change c++ style comments to c style and remove the
	use of non-static initializers to allow the SunPRO c compiler to be
	able to compile this file.

2003-02-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* src/autoroute.c: coding style fixes to allow this to be compiled
	with the SunPRO c compiler.  Changes are moving from c++ style
	comments to c style comments and getting rid of non-static
	initializers.

2003-02-21   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* README.cvs: - add section on checking out via anoncvs and updating via anoncvs.  - point to INSTALL document for what to do afte bootstrapping the
	  auto* tools

2003-02-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* doc/Imakefile, doc/pcb.texi.in, doc/pcb.texi.raw,
	doc/refcard.tex.in, doc/refcard.tex.raw: remove obsolete files

2003-02-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* : these don't really belong in CVS.  The sources are in the doc/
	directory and they do get generated and put into the distfile when a
	release is made.

2003-02-20   Dan McMahill * dan AT mcmahill dot net *

	* : remove obsolete file (the contents live in pcb/newlib/ now
