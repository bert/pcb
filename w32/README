Minipack

Homepage: http://code.google.com/p/minipack
This minipack distribution was customized for the PCB project.

Minipack is an automated build tool. Given a set of recipes and patches, it
downloads the sources, unpacks them, applies local patches, builds them and
installs them. Its primary use is for cross-compiling free software to
Windows, but minipack is more general-purpose than that.

To install, unpack it in any directory, and optionally set the PATH to it.

The tool can be run from anywhere, but it looks for a minipack.conf file
in the current directory or in a parent directory.

Some recipes for cross-compiling to Windows are included in the distribution:
* libraries: gtk+, guile, gd, freetype, libpng, jpeg, zlib, gettext.
* applications: gEDA/gaf, PCB.
See the 'recipes' directory for a full list.

When cross-compiling, you need a suitable cross-compiler for the host you are
targeting. On Debian and derivatives, you can type 'sudo apt-get install mingw32'
to get a MinGW cross-compiler. You can also build your own by using the build
script provided by the MinGW project.

Modify the host setting in the minipack.conf file to reflect the cross-compiler
being used. It can be found as the prefix of the compiler, eg. i586-mingw32msvc.

The build-all.sh script can be used to build all packages in one run. Edit the
BUILD list to select only a subset. Beware, some recipes require a native
version of pkg-config, others need the autotools and/or intltool as well.

  mpk
=======

The main (and only) tool of minipack is called mpk:
* mpk build <package>  - download, unpack, and build a package.
* mpk unpack <package> - download and unpack a package
* mpk source <package> - download a source package
* mpk shell [package]  - enter a shell with a pre-defined build environment

A cache of downloaded sources is kept in the 'sources' directory.

To add more recipes to minipack, place the recipe in the 'recipes' directory
and place the patches in a subdirectory of the 'patches' directory.

Have fun!
